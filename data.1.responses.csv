"Vadare is a rival country that has past history with cyber-attacks and stands to benefit from disrupting our election system. Using evidence from past attacks on our air control system, it is logical to believe that they would have the potential to attack the voting system. It can also be seen how Vidare would gain if a leader won that was in favor of Vadare.","I would still stay with leaning the attack on Vadare, but would have to further investigate the Cyber attack group and see if it could at all be traced back to the group rather than Vadare. The difficult part would be if citizens of Vadare are also part of the Cyber-attack group."
"It makes sense that the cyber-attack most likely came from Vadare. If Vadare had been intentionally antagonistic towards my country in the months preceding the election, it would be easy to assume that a cyber-attack would another antagonistic action Vadare would be capable of. Since Vadare has also made it clear that they wish for a conservative candidate to be elected in my country, they may have planned the cyber-attack in an attempt to make the election of a conservative candidate more likely. However, I would not want to rule out the possibility of another country being behind the cyber-attack. Another country might be behind the cyber-attack and will assume that I will automatically blame Vadare since they have been blatant with their disagreements toward my country. It would be easy to hide behind the spectacle Vadare has already made. I would want to keep this possibility in mind while exploring all options because I wouldn't want to leave my country open to an unsuspecting attack because I am too focused on Vadare. ","I do not think that this new information rules out Vadare completely. This group could have been possibly hired or paid by Vadare to perform the cyber-attack. Vadare may wanted to have a second-hand group enact the cyber-attack so that it would not be linked directly back to them. Vadare may assume that my country would find out about the group's doing and dismiss the cyber-attack as a prank, but I would still remain vigilant. "
It's clear from the evidence presented that they are  behind the attacks.  In addition they have the most to gain from inspiring instability in our government.  Thus the conclusion that they  are responsible is entirely reasonable.,Given the new information it's not so clear.  it's very possible this anarchist group is making it appear that the Vadare are behind the attacks in order to throw us off or create chaos.  At the same time it's possible that Vadare is using this groups reputation or the group themselves to commit the cyber hacking.
"Our intelligence community said that it is from Vadare, and there inflammatory nature towards our boarder seems to support this. Considering other intrusions that they have made at our boarder and statements made by the present of Vadare, it seems to fit in line with their agenda. They are also seem to have a pattern of ignoring the value of human life, as with this air traffic control attack. ","Without more proof, it is dangerous to say that Vadere mounted these attacks. If it is also (perhaps equally) possible that CyperChaosCrew did this, we should not be quick to assign blame to Vadare. Besides, the disruption of ATC is more dangerous and should be investigated more thoroughly, anyway. That needs our attention more. "
"Well, the attack has been traced back to computers used by the Vadare Gov. However, unless the computers are currently within the Vadare Gov and have been operated specifically by Vadare Gov. officials, it cannot be 100% ascertained that the attack was definitely on the orders of the Vadare Gov. It could have been initiated by independent Vadare citizens. There is also a small chance it could be a frame-up to inflame the situation between the two countries.","There is still the issue that the attack was traced back to Vadare Gov. computers.  Although the hacker group likely infiltrated the Vadare Gov. network, it cannot be completely ruled out the the Vadare Gov. either 1) allowed the attack to go ahead/approached the hacker group or 2) that there are independent elements of the Vadare Gov. that are affiliated with the hacker group and thus instigated the attack."
"I wouldn't put 100% trust it was Vadare, they could have been set up.  I would prefer to keep all options until I had evidence pointing that it was definitley Vadare.",I'm not 100% sure it was Vadare or the cyber company so I would keep my options open regarding pointing fingers.
"The attack was traced to government computers from Vadare. However, this does not mean that they are responsible; an attack could have been made to look like it came from there, or it could have been conducted without the Vadare govenrment's approval. However, given the trace and Vadare's prior behavior, they are a likely suspect.",The new information makes it more probable that the attack came from actors other than the Vadare government.
"No  proof  was provided (e.g. reliable sources, industry experts). The vignette was statements implied to be fact. Other alternatives did not seem to have been investigated and ruled out. I don't know much about the countries and there relationships with other countries (are there other countries?). ",Forensic evidence sounds factual improving the integrity of the evidence and possibly contradicting the initial statement. I know nothing of the hacker group or it's possible ties to Vadare. As such I would feel less confident that Vadare was responsible for the cyber-attack. I would also feel that Vadare may be being used as a scapegoat.
The National Security organisation should have access to the tools necessary to investigate such issues. As director I would expect them to provide me full and correct information about what they've found. I've been given no reason to question them.,There's more doubt now about the source of the problems but I don't remember reading anything in the first information that said it was the tools themselves that had been the sole reason to accuse the Valderans. I would expect there to be a wider range of information that would lead to the organisation telling me they were to blame. So without more detail I moved just one step nearer not confident. 
"It's all circumstantial, no proof.","As before, it's all hearsay. Without any real proof it means nothing."
There has been previous and they do not like us ,There's a different company that has been doing it a lot recently 
One Vadare was identified as the proponent of this cyber attack and it is one of Vadare's modus.,This adds another level of complexity to the analysis. Still focused on Vadadre due to the past history but this new group does need to be investigated also to determine if they had any hand in the cyber attack.
We are in dispute with Vadare and they have history of intruding in their neighbours affairs.  they support a far right candidate over the current government,"There is a known hacktivist group that has been hacking into computers in the last 12 months, so it could be them not Vadare but not sure one or the other"
"Anyone capable of pulling off a sophisticated cyber-attack on a large scale is capable of masking the origins of the attack. This will take more effort, but it can be done. In fact, cyber-attacks are one of the best ways to engage in a  false flag  attack.  In this scenario, it is quite reasonable to think of reasons why others might wish to initiate a cyber-attack and have it attributed to Vadare.   For instance, the political opponents of the  far right  candidate might be completely corrupt, and they might have selected a very poor and unpopular candidate to represent them, and so they might think that concocting a fake attack by Vadare might turn the people against the  far right  candidate.  That is an option that has at least some plausibility.","If the tools are known to be used by the CyberChaosCrew, then they most likely did the attack, or someone tried to make it look like they did. It is not entirely clear why Vadare would perform the attack and try to pin it on this group. Perhaps Vadare is aiming to sow chaos, but it might seem that they would do better at this by making the attack look like it comes from multiple sources. Or perhaps they would gain by creating confusion as to who is doing the attack. Vadare is an option, but it seems more likely that CyberChaosCrew did it themselves."
"I would need to see the evidence, however, if a governing body has managed to trace this back to Vadare then I cannot argue with the evidence.  As I am not 100% confident, I would want to put another investigation in place by a different, independent body to check that they came to the same conclusions.  Assuming they do, I would then use this evidence to be  very confident .  If the second investigation was not conclusive, I would not be quite as confident in the cyber-attack.  Although Vadare has far right tendencies, I would not use these to cloud my judgement over the cyber attack.","I have no reason to doubt the evidence if it conclusively pointed to Vadare.  The new information regarding the cyber attack crew would not have any impact on the evidence.  I would, however, want an investigation into the cyber attack crew to see if any of their traits were present.  As before, I would want another independent investigation to be carried out."
"Since Vadare have a history of this kind of attack, and since they have also attacked Idimore by other means, it seems likely -- but by no means certain -- that the cyber-attack is also their work. However, more investigation would be needed to be certain (or as close to certain as is possible); it's entirely possible that other actors are involved and are trying to blame Vadare for their own actions.","The CyberChaosCrew could, of course, be working for or with Vadare. We really do not have enough detailed information to come to any firm conclusion about who is responsible at this stage."
Previous behaviours that originated from Vadare point to this recent cyber-attack coming once again from Vadare.  The candidate supported by Vadare in the elections has been doing unusually well in the polls too.,"This new information sheds a lot of doubt on my original thoughts, and to accuse Vadare of this attack with the knowledge that the attack could have been caused by someone else could jeapardise relations with Vadare and the security of my country."
"The vignette lists Vadare as the culprit so I am simply accepting the vignette as the sole source of truth. It is a vignette, after all. If this was not a vignette, then there would be a need to make that determination after a reasoned and through investigation.","There are now two possible culprits so a through investigation would be needed. I would initially lean toward Vadare since the scale seems more like that of a state-sponsored attack, but it is a slight lean."
I am fairly confident that Vadare are behind the attack. I base this on their past behaviour. Supported by the fact they want to unseat the current government,I still find it kilely that vadare are behind the attack. I can understand a hacking group attacking government systems for fun. I do not believe they would endanger life by hacking air traffic control
I assume it came from Vadare because that is what the vignette said and the hostilities attributed to the country are inline with the cyber attack. It could have came from another government or an unofficial source in my country or Vadare or another country.,"The hacker group could be doing work for Vadare for money or another incentive, but most likely not. I would have some suspensions of Vadare but set my sites on the hacker group. "
"While historically Vadare has been known to use cyber-atacks, that does not mean a priori that they are the source of this attack without further evidence. Another party would rightly assume that Vadare would be blamed, and try to use that to their advantage.","New evidence has come to light, but that does not mean that Vadare is not involved directly or indirectly with the other group which may be leading the cyber-attack."
Vadare have a history of antagonistic behaviour. Vadare do not like the current Government so will do things like this to rock the boat. Vadare have a history of cyber attacks.,The extra information throws into doubt Vadares role in the cyber attacks. The extra information states that the protest group use cyber attacks. 
History and intelligence supports this view. It is in their interest and modus operandi to disrupt our Country. However no definitive proof available at this time.,Not directly linked to Valdane far as we know so probability reduces however their previous history still makes them a prime suspect.
it makes sense as this would be fitting to similar strategys vadare has completed in the past. ,"well because of the new information, perhaps it wasnt valdare"
"Vadare is known to be our greatest enemy. They have a policy toward our country that seeks to harm us using any means necessary including cyber attacks. Their president is currently publicly advocating that a far right candidate takes over our government. The president publicly says that our current government is illegitimate. Our air traffic control system is currently under cyber attacks. Considering everything, this strongly points toward Vadare being behind the cyber attack.","I think that it is a 50-50 chance that it is still Vadare. But I am willing to go up to 70%. It is highly possible that Vadare is using the hacker's software to hide their cyber-attack and have deniability. Also, based on the history of Vadare toward Idimore, I wouldn't put it past Vadare to use 3rd party actors as a shield."
"There seems very strong circumstantial Evidence that Vadere carried out this attack. They are very active politically. However there is no concrete evidence they actually did carry out this specific atttack,",There seems additional evidence that another group may have carried out the attack.
Some allusions have been made that the government in Vadare has used aggressive tactics in the past to facilitate their agenda. However the information is circumstantial at this point and not concrete. So i think there's reason to be suspicious but not accusatory. Disputes that have occurred between Vadare and Idiomum,"I feel less suspicious of Vadare now as this other organisation CCP has known to be involved in cyber attacks for fun that target Government computers, hence there is a possibility that this new organization could have used advanced technology to make it look like an attack from the Vadare government."
"It's a reasonable conclusion and the most likely, but it is possible it's a random attack or that someone is trying to present Valdare as the culprit","Valdare still has motivation and means, and could be trying to throw my people off track, or, be using the group to further their ends"
"Both Idimore and Vadare have been involved in a series of disputes in the past that are often initiated by Vadare. Vadare is known to pursue its interests using all possible means at its disposal that include, but are not limited to, trade embargoes, military intrusions across the border, and cyber-attacks. ","Both Idimore and Vadare have been involved in a series of disputes in the past that are often initiated by Vadare. Vadare is known to pursue its interests using all possible means at its disposal that include, but are not limited to, trade embargoes, military intrusions across the border, and cyber-attacks. "
They have participated in previous cyber attacks. They have also suggested that the current administration is not legitimate. They have an interested in the election. It would benefit them to disrupt it. ,"Assuming they cannot be hired, the purpose for which the cyber attack happened could have been purely for fun which would not match with what vadare had done previously. "
"The attack was focused only on your Country and specifically Government systems. This had a negative effect on thee efficient operation of the Country , and no blackmail or coercion has resulted. Vadare could Politically benefit from disruption of the election transferring from system dominated approach to a less secure paper based approach. They are supporting the opposition in the election. ","There could be a 'fun' motive for the attack based upon this new group. However there still could be benefit resulting from this attack to Vdare, so they can not be ruled out. Again there does not seem to be any monetary gain in the attack."
Based on their history with our country. They are known rivals who wish us ill will. They have a vested interest in the results of the election. Therefore they have the motive and also the means of carrying out the attack.,There is now another possible culprit in the mix  with previous form and this casts doubt on the previous supposition.
"Because they are questioning the current administration,.also because they support an opposition candidate so strongly, I would suspect that they are trying to bring down the current administration. They have also previously attacked my country.",The new suspected groups history better fits what has happened to my country.
Vadare have prior in this kind of thing and have often expressed far right views. ,They are still a suspicious group but can?t be held responsible unless proven. Other people can also hack just for fun whereas vadare have an agenda 
"The originating computers were in Vadare, they start most disputes and seek what they need by any means. These three factors would suggest they are likely to be involved in some way at least. ","It would be silly to not consider other possibilities, but given the computers were traced back to the neighbouring country I would still put a lot of weight on that rather than the new information. "
"I have read in the vignette that Vadare are highly likely to be responsible for the cyber attack. Unless I have proof for myself, I am not 100% confident that they attack came from there but feel that it is likely. There is evidence that the cyber attack came from government's computers within that area.",I have been given information that cyber attacks have occurred but the new information doesn't prove that the attacks came from Vadare. The new information tells me that the attacks have been occurring for 12 months but not where from. 
"Valdares background indicates that they have motive to disrupt Idimore to gain an advantage, whether political or economical.  Investigations also indicate that the cyber-attack originated from Valdare.  Valdare has historically initiated attacks on Idimore.",The new information indicates that the motive for the cyber attack may have been motivated for fun rather than any politic or economic gain.  The fact that the cyber group has previously undertaken hacking activities for fun and disruption slightly lessens the chances that the attack was politically driven.  More information is needed regarding the cyber group and their connections with the ruling authority of Vadare.
"I have never been into politics and world policies, but I know that many of these cyber attacks and finger pointing episodes in the news are predominantly false flags. All evidence in this scenario points to Vadare being the source of these attacks. However, given the conditioning I have undergone by simply watching and reading the news, I cannot be entirely sure without further evidence. ","Again, the same as the last. There is so much information not being presented that I have no idea how I could, as a leader of a country, in good conscience accuse another country of committing acts of war. Now, if they had a large supply of oil and other natural resources, I might be persuaded otherwise :) "
"Vadare has previously been involved in cyber attacks, plus it has used other means available (eg. limiting trade with an embargo) to get what it wants.  The current actions seem congruent with how Valdare has behaved in the past.","With forensic evidence, it seems there is a greater probability for other explanations for the cyber attack, and it could be possible this cyber attacking group was behind the most recent attack."
It seems likely as they have been hostile but there is not clear evidence to confirm this.,I don?t know where the hacking group are based or if they have been employed by Vadare's government 
"I am very confident in Vadare being responsible for the cyber-attack. This is because of their reckless and ruthless nature to gain what they desire. In addition, there have been many disputes with Vadare with them being the instigators, it would be like that this incident was a result of one of those disputes and that Vadare would seek to gain something from this cyber-attack.","I've decided to change my earlier assessment of Vadare's role in the cyber attack. This is mainly because of what the motive of the group behind the cyber-attack was. Fun, in this case wouldn't be beneficial to Vadare's interests as they would seek to gain something from the cyber attack that would benefit them for the long-term."
"They have a history of not getting along with my country.  In addition, they have been known to use any methods they can to affect our country.  They had the motive and the means which has me almost convinced that it was them.",I am a little less sure about this since there is another possibility.  I still think that it is Vadare since they have the motive.  I would keep an open mind though and have moved the slider slightly away from my confidence level before just because there is not a possible different reason though I would think that this other group would have taken credit.
"Vadare is known to execute cyber attacks like the ones the country suffered. Its leader has also shown support for a far-right leader in my country, during an election. Due to this, and past enmity between the two countries, it is highly probable Vadare initiated the attack.","The new evidence indicates a specific group was responsible. However, its methods are the same as those used by Vadare in the past. It's possible the hacktivists did this of their own volition, but it's also possible they were encouraged by Vadare."
I thought that Vadare were behind the attack as they appear to have a good motive for the attack. They have a past reputation of attacks on the other country. They also favoured one of the right wing candidates. They also have previously used whatever means necessary to get what they want.,I am slightly less sure now as this group have attacked other governments. Vadare could have paid the group to perform the attack as it appears to be to their advantage. The group could also have attacked alone and are just targetting different governments. I still belive it is most likely that the attack came from Vadare.
There is very little information on vadare's cyber warfare capabilities. All the evidence is circumstantial.,The new evidence seems to lessen the chance of the attacked being orchestrated by vadare. However they could have employed the group of hackers.
"It makes sense that Vadare would be behind the attacks as they haven't been shy about claiming responsibility for attacks in the past. They are actively trying to undermine the current administration and it wouldn't be far-fetched to expect that they would try and influence the vote. I only am 8/10 confident, however, because there is always the possibility of a third party having its own reasons to commit cyber attacks during the vote.","I moved my confidence down as the reason for not being 100% confident in the last question was that a third-party may have its own motives. With a tangible third party threat, it seems more likely it could be either Vadare or this new threat."
"I am confident that Vadare was behind the cyber attack, as it was traced back to computers operated by Vadare. The previous disputes between the two countries and Vadare's approach to those past problems mean that they will likely continue to attack my country. Furthermore, the president of Vadare has shown interest in the election and a strong preference for a specific candidate. ","Given the new information, it is still most likely that the attack came from Vadare as they have shown interest in the election, attacked in the past, and this specific attack has been traced back to their government's computers. However, because the tools used in the attack are also employed by a different cyber attack group, I cannot be as certain that the attack came from Vadare."
Vacate has been responsible for several previous attacks and for casting doubt on the happenings within my country. It is a neighbouring country and so would have reason to want to attack. ,I am less sure now as there is evidence that the attack may have come from a different group. This group has carried out previous cyber attacks for fun and the attack is in line with their previous ones. 
as it stated in the vignette - a professional security body found the attacks to be coming from computers based in that country. unless this is a false reading of signals or the agency is corrupt in someway and has ulterior motives. i suspect this is trying to draw a slight comparison with the US election recently.,Again the signals came from a geographical location within Vadare. so unless they are using a proxy this is the only logical conclusion. I am uncertain whether the question is asking if the attack had come from the country's government.
Vadare has been persistently attacking our nation for some time. There is evidence that the attack came from their servers. Additionally Vadare's leadership has questioned the legitimacy of our government is supporting a specific leader in our elections and essentially trying to influence the outcome of such election. ,"If this third party organization has the tools necessary to attack our servers that technology can be sold to foreign government. Vadare may have bought or stolen the technology to use against us. Or, consequently, this third party organization can in fact been a screen for the Vadare government's actions. "
"There's a strong motive for Valdare to conduct these attacks, and given that they are a sovereign country I think it's fair to assume that they also have the means and opportunity to conduct attacks. My reservations stem from the lack of actual evidence of Valdare's involvement","I am a little less confident as there is another possible culprit that also has means and opportunity, as well as the motive of 'fun'. I did not reduce my score further, however, as the presence of other suspects does not negate the factors that made Valdare a valid suspect. Equally, there is also no actual evidence that the hacktivists are responsible"
"The proof of involvement appears to stem from past issues with them influencing events within the country. I have not seen direct proof of this myself and have only heard what I have been told by others, therefore there is no way that I can be completely confident that they were the cause of the cyber attack. Although evidently I have my suspicions,","This lessens the idea that Vadare had any involvement in the attack, as I have been given no evidence that there is any link between this group and Vadare."
"That the attack came from within a government facility in Vadare is without doubt, our operatives are highly trained and skilled and have successfully traced the source. What we cannot assess is whether the source is government sponsored or from a devious malcontent.","Well we have some new information. There are strong signs of a hacking groups signature all over this cyber attack. We have no reason to believe that Valdare would try to fake such a scenario as it would likely backfire on themselves. No, this one is not down to Valdare even if they would like it to be."
Vadare has a history of aggressive and hostile attacks against Idimore. Vardare is promoting and supporting the election of a far right candidate in Idimore. Vardare to questioning the legitimacy of the current government of Idimore so is already involved in influencing the election. It seems reasonable to conclude that Verdure is behind the Cyber attack.,I think that further investigation would be needed but I think that in the context of Vardare already being involved in influencing the election and in light of their previous hostile actions it is likely they would be be involved in the Cyber attack. The onus would now be on Vardare to prove that it was the hackers and not them. Vardare have proved to be untrustworthy and may be suggesting it is this new group.
i can only believe what i have been told within the short story.  As i have no other information to indicate that the attack came from anywhere else therefore it must be what i have read,actually the new information gave no further evidence for where the attack has come from.
"I believe Vadare are responsible for the attack because of the history of problems and recent events. However, there is no definite evidence that Vignette are responsible I would not be completely sure they were responsible. As there does not  appear to be an alternative reason for the attack.","This evidence would increase my doubts as to whether Vadare's role because there is an alternative option for the problems.  However, based on the history between the 2, I would not entirely rule out Vadare's role. There is evidence to support the theory that Vadare is responsible but the group who inflict cyber problems for fun is now a reasonable option."
I would not be confident in incriminating Vadare being solely responsible for the cyber attack. There is still little actual evident to incriminate. I would want to investigate further to ensure I had evidence before conflict was caused.,Their appears to be more evidence to suggest that Vadare are not the only group that could responsible for the attack. With the evidence provided it appears it?s  More likely to be the other group that has caused the cyber attack as evidence suggest they have the ability and have been involved in similar events previously.
"The attack was traced back to government computers operated by Vadare.  Also, previous disputes have been initiated by Vadare in the past, and Vadare has used cyber attacks in the past.  So this all leads me to suspect this present cyber-attack came from Vadare.","There is now a chance the attack came from the hacktivist group CyberChaosCrew.  But due to the previous conflicts between the two countries it is still likely to have come from Vadare, but ever so less likely."
"The attack came from computers operated by Valdare. They may benefit financially from being able to control the elections, which is presumably easier to do with paper ballots. They have history of instigating aggressive actions against Idomere.","Another group who has history of interfering with government business, may have been involved. The techniques used in the cyber attack are the same as those employed by the hacktivist group. This casts doubt on the assertion that Valdare were involved."
The cyber attack was tracked back to computers in Vardare's government  It is most likely that the attack therefore came from them.  But it is possible to make a cyber attack look like it is coming from a location that it does not,Although the cyber attack appeared to come from Valdare's government...   If they have been the victims of a hack by CyberChaosCrew it is possible that this hack is responsible for the cyber attack and that the government of Valdare know nothing about it.   CyberChaosCrew are known to target their hacks towards big government systems.
"We not only have a history with this country that is less than stellar, but the attacks were traced back to their computers. This is a clear indicator to me, though with the knowledge that these facts can be faked, I am not confident enough to give it an evaluation of 10. ","I dropped one level, given the pattern and the fact that it indicates that this group may be involved. Their methods as well as their target attacks match the information in question. "
The attacks were traced back to Vadare government computers. I didn't see information about the reliability of the trace but I'm assuming it is accurate. The use of cyber attacks seems to be in keeping with what I know of the Vadare government's tactics and the present political climate.,The tools are in common with the hactivists but that's a bit vague. I'm now on the fence as the reliability of the trace is in question but the link to the hactivist group is not definitive.
There is motive for Vadare to engage in the cyber-attack.,"There is another group who could have instigated the cyber attack, thereby decreasing the chance that Vadare was responsible."
I think the president of vadare has a motive. He wants the far right candidate to be the president and this may influence the vote somehow. It is likely Vadare however it is not possible with the information given to say that for definite.,Vadare still has a motive. These actions could change or influence the result which would be favourable. However with this new information it makes me less confident that it was them for sure
the attack was traced back to Vadare by the security centre so it seems logical that 's where it came from.,"It now seems logical that Vadare was targeted by the hackers, making it appear like Vadare is to blame."
vadare have a history of planning and implementing attacks of us and i believe this cyber attack has been launched at a crucial time to try and discredit the current administration and to cause as much disruption as possible during the voting process.,i still believe its down to vadare for the same reasons as before and they also may have paid for this to be done.
Vidare has consistently engaged in immoral behavior. They have been transparent about their desires to upend order in my nation. No other entity seems like a likely culprit. ,"With the new information, it's hard to say who is involved. It seems equally likely to be the hacktivist group or Vildare. Can't say which is responsible. "
"The national security centre traced the attack back to vadare. Given the reliability of network analysis tools this makes the information very trustworthy. What is not clear is whether the Vadare government is involved, though given previous disruption it seems they have the motivation","The evidence for the use of certain tools does not strongly implicate the group made the attack, and the network analysis data still stands as the attack originated from Vadare. What is unknown is the location of the hacker group"
The NCSC traced it back there.  They are in dispute with us.   It seems more than likely ,Other people also do it.  The other people have been doing it before.   It might actually be them
Vadare is known to have previously embarked on hostile attacks against the country.   They are not limited in their resources or targets for acquiring control/ information.   There is strong evidence to suggest that the attack is coming directly from an IP address located there. ,It doesn't state where the CyberChaosCrew are based. They may have the ability to make things appear differently to the reality - ie they might be somewhere else not the suggested IP address.   However I would still be inclined to assume that the attack is coming from there given other facts preceeding this. More needs to materialise before deciding.
Research shows this. There is evidence that they have motive.,Still no evidence that Valdare are not involved. 
"Vadare has a history of causing problems, They oppose us and our government and this is the type of behavior that I would expect from them. Vadare seems to be a likely source of the cyber attack.","It would be like Vadare to use the cyber chaos crew to further their own agenda. It could have been the work of hackers alone, but I still strongly suspect Vadare. I won't count them out."
"The attack was traced back to Vadare which, if true, is good evidence. Vadare have a history of initiating attacks etc. They might want to meddle with the elections to get the candidate they want.",It does decrease how confident I am that valdare were responsible as there?s forensic evidence to support the fact another group might have done it. 
The attack is just too coincidental. It would give them the means to disrupt the system and give them an advantage. ,Although it is still possible that it could be an attack from Vadare this new information throws doubt on that assumption. Without further information we cannot be sure
"Well they are a neighboring country and they want to push their own candidate, there was no evidence given in that scenario to convince me that it came from somewhere else.","I am less confident because I do not know where this group of hackers is based, however I still believe it could have come from Vadare because they are kind of an enemy"
"The two countries have been having disputes and Vadare has been interfering in the politics of Idimore and will use any means necessary to get what they want, there is also evidence that traces the cyber attack to Vadare .","I am still sure it was Vadare as they seem intent on getting what the want, but have a slight doubt with the new evidence about Cyber Chaos Crew. "
The biggest evidence is that the cyber attack has been traced back to Vadare.    This evidence is supported by the fact that the countries are currently in a dispute and the president has directly questioned the administration of the country.,"Judging on the new evidence presented, there is nothing to tell me where the attack has come from. Although we know which group did the attack, it seems it was done by a group of individuals that aren't representing Vadare, they just do it for fun and could be located anywhere."
It is consistent with their previous behavior. They have expressed support for a candidate so it's likely they would want to interfere with the election. The history between the countries would make them the number 1 suspect. ,"I decided to change a little as it means they might be behind the attack. However, I still think it's most likely than Vadare did it because of our history and their previous behavior. Also they have expressed support for a candidate and would likely want to jeopardize the government. "
The National Cyber Security Center (NCSC) traced the attack back to government computers operated by your neighboring country.   I would presume that they had the intention to do so. Plus it seems that they are trying to rig the vote. I guess it would be in their best interest. ,"It seems that the information by the cybersecurity team could have been manipulated.   With that in mind, I cant say that I could condemn anyone without further proof.  I would need to re-analyze information and create a new hypothesis and maybe get some better statistics.  "
The computers have been traced back to the government in Vardare. There are tensions between the two countries. Vardare have shown support for one candidate in the election.,There is no motive for this group. Vardare have a stronger motive for this attack. There is no evidence against this group.
There is a history of conflict and cyber attacks previously. The source had been traced to Vadare government offices. Can't remember anymore!,The information states that a group are responsible for the cyber attack. They have a history of targeting government computers. 
The information given makes me unsure which end of the scale to commit to. I think there is definitely suggestion that Vadare are behind the attack but I would not be confident asserting that. ,I am less sure how that Vadare are behind the attack. With mention of a new group it complicates my thought process on this. 
It was traced back to government systems in Vadare.,"There has been reports of cyber attacks from the 3rd party group, but the previous info has already said it came from Vadare."
"As the director, I should be certain that I can confident in the sources within my own organisation. I would have spoken to members of the team who had made the findings. The systems that were in place should ensure that the information is accurate",This new evidence would call into question the assumption that Vadare are the only organisation with a motivation. Further investigation would be required to ascertain the source of the attack in order to give confident answer. Until this was certain I would not be confident to make any accusations.
"Although the computers were based in the country it's not clear whether it was nationals, government endorsed, a rebel group, or even own nationals operating from other country.",This new piece of info shows that it is not likely to be govt endorsed. Alhough the possibility that it is remains.
"I'm the director and if I know I have a competent, objective staff at the NCSC to trace where it came from, they'll give me the correct answer. I know the teams that are involved with the leaders that are trustworthy supervising the work. I can trust that they aren't tainting the information. And it's been concluded by teams working independently on where it's coming from.","I still think it's the neighboring country, Vadare. Though we haven't been attacked by the cybergroup before, they usually like to take credit when they do, just to show they can. So far we haven't received any messaging from them."
The attack has so far been traced back to vadare and no one else has been suspected ,New knowledge has come forward indicting another suspect group 
I am not completely certain that the cyber attack came from Vadare however if our system detected that it came from this location I would put some trust into it. I am still weary though as maybe a VPN or some other type of service could have been used during the cyber attack. I believe that further investigation should be done before any more larger announcements are made and that great caution shall be made so that any important information or the well being of others isn't jeopardized.  ,I am not knowledgeable on this cyber group so it doesn't effect my position. I believe that if I was given more information on the origins of this group I could make a better assessment however since I lack this my position shall stay the same. Also my lack of knowledge on Vadare and cyber attacks in general play a role in this decision as well.
There was no evidence that the attack came from them,the attack matches attacks perfomed before a certain group - they do not identify as from Vadare
the caual link between the proven and implied involvement of your  bad  neighbour is too coincidental to be an accident,There is now a level of uncertainty that could easi;ly cast boubt over any assumption made in trhe absence of clear proof
I think the vignette described the cyber attacks as being 'suspected to come from Vadare'. That doesn't imply a lot of evidence is available to confirm the suspicion,the evidence now seems to point to an independent organisation rather than  the government of the neighbouring country
"The cyber attack was presumed to originate from government computers in Vadare but the attack could simply have been designed to look like that.  A skilled IT person could easily arrange this.  A bit like in the UK salisbury attacks, always look past the obvious as to why someone would like it to appear the attack from Vadare.",There is no proof that the attack came from this group either.  Nothing was provided to make me change my evaluation.  It could be either or neither.
"Despite the seemingly overwhelming statement that the attack was linked to computers in Vadare it is not beyond reason to question the legitimacy of these claims if there was a third agent involved, it is also not without doubt that there could be a form of proxy or VPN that could be masking the real origin of the cyber attack.","My previous answer discussed the possibility of a third agent.  This could potentially point to the hacktivist group as they use similar tools and methods, this reduces my original confidence as if the group are to blame then it is much less of a state attack. "
It would be wrong to presume the attack came from Vadare. May be an inside job,There is still no reason to believe that. A date is involved. 
Our agency has identified a state controlled computer to have been directly responsible for the attack. However there is no clear motive and it is impossible to know at this stage whether their infrastructure has been compromised by an additional party wanting to implicate Vadare,It appears less likely that Vadare are involved in the attack as a third party has been identified who have previous form for committing this type of offence. It seems unlikely that this group of individuals have collaborated at a government level. The methods used are likely to be covert and may not have been detected by the government led agents
"As head of the cyber protection unit my staff have traced the attack back to computers in Vadare, and these are government computers.  If this is sanctioned by the Vadare government then they are acting in a hostile manner.  However,  given that cyber security is still a developing field there is a small possibility that either the government computers are being used by individuals without the government's knowledge or permission, in which case my country and Vadare are both under attack and need to work together, or that we have not fully traced the attack's source and the Vadare government computers are a smoke screen.  These options are probably less likely as we are a government organisation presumably with funding and expertise, and would notice if either was the case.",This new information increases the possibility that the Vadare government computers are under attack themselves or being used as cover for computers somewhere else with the trace misdirected.  We need to work together with the Vadare government to figure this out.
The NCSC operating as the security services for your country has informed you that the attack did indeed come from Vadare.  Any country can only rely on information from it's own security sources and there is no reason to suspect that the information is incorrect.  IT would not be helpful if the information from your own country's security services was then deemed not confident unless there were extraneous circumstances - but these are not detailed on the previous screen.,"Based on the new information, this is enough to create doubt in the confidence of the data that had previously thought to have come from the Security services.  The message you should now be conveying to the leader is that further investigation is required to analyse where the security attack did indeed come from.  Furthermore, there should be no accusations cast towards Vadare until more concrete details are obtained."
Although it says the cyber attacks came from government computers it Vadare. It may be that they were also hacked and that's what caused the attack on my country. There is nothing to suggest that the country of Vadare would have any reason to launch a cyber attack on us. ,I think it is the hacking group that has launched the cyber attack and for fun they have made it look like it was coming from Vadare. As well as the cyber attack this would also create negative conflict between the two neighbouring countries. 
The neighbouring country was mentioned in the vignette as to be responsible. This was identified by the organisation I work for after investigation. I am quite sure it was this country.,It did not state that further investigation had changed the source of the attack from Vadare. Only that it was also linked with a hacktivist group which could have been undertaken by the neighbouring country.
Because The National Cyber Security Center  traced the attack back to government computers operated by Vadare.,a group known to attack government systems could be responsible for the cyber attack
"Because they were responsible for the prior event, it is reasonable to suspect them in this new event.  There is a chance they are not to blame, but it is remote.  After more evidence is produced, one can decide with a higher degree of certainty whether or not the Vadarians are responsible.","Now that it is know that hackivists are involved, Vadare may or may not be involved.  One must examine the links between the two groups to find out.  After the two groups are investigated, more evidence should be available to decide the guilt or innocence of Vadare."
"Computer locations can be hidden.  The attack may have come from Vadare or it could have come from someone who wanted us to think it was Vadare.  Perhaps the NSCS  couldn't locate the location at all but rather than admit this, they've just chosen someone who it is hard to prove it is not.","They have past form for this so it's not impossible.  There could however be a copycat group.  Vadare could still be guilty and have just used this group's tactics to help defer the blame.  A different country may have copied this group as an extra level of suspicion, if we didn't believe in Vadare's guilt."
Whilst I suspect that it may well be Vadare's that have attacked our internet.  There appears to be no concrete evidence supplied that it was them.  Merely a suggestion that it must have been them as they are our enemy.  But in order for the president to act he needs facts.,"As previously stated, actual facts are required before pointing the finger at any one party for the attack.  I have even further down graded the assessment that it was Vadare and are recommending that nothing is done until the truth is known"
"As director of the NCSC, I would have confidence in my team and their sources.  If I have confidence in my team and they tell me that is the case, I should trust in what they say.  I would be happier with more information though.",Another player has been suggested as a possible originator.  I would be more confident if I knew what led my team to believe it was Vadare.  As Director of the NCSC I imagine my team would already know if the chaos team and have reasons for suggesting Vadare instead.
Vadare has a lot to gain for messing with more election and other computer dependent services. The evidence of the cyber attack location is evidence that they are behind this. But it could be another country who wants to hurt or relations with Vadare. ,The act by this group can be personal or done by contract from Vadare. Only more information can make this conclusion sure. I can't let past issues with Vadare hurt current relations if I a wrong.
It has been traced back by cyber security and there have been subsequent attacks so it would seem likely that they were responsible.,Although it originally seemed that it did. With further evidence it would seem that the new group were doing it to cause problems
"The cyber-attack was traced back to Vadare by my own department, the NCSC, in which I have complete faith. My recommendation to the president is therefore without hesitation.",The new information does cast some doubt onto the possible role of Vadare. I would indicate that I am no longer certain of the origin of the cyber attack and would list futher actions I would take to resolve the issue.
"The cyber attack was traced back to computers from Vadare. Therefore, someone from Vadare caused the cyber attack. The only other scenario could be that someone else has set it up to look like this is what happened.",The new information means that it is not certain that the cyber attack came from Vadare. It could be that this other group caused the cyber attack. More information would be needed to know for sure.
"Whilst the National Cyber Security Center traced the attack back to Vadare, it's always possible that they are either wrong or lying for political purposes - & there's not enough information to be certain if either could be the case.","As noted previously, it was possible that the National Cyber Security Center were either wrong or lying for political purposes.    Now, the question asks if the attack came from Vadare, NOT if the Vadare government were behind it - so, whilst I've lowered the likelihood slightly, there's nothing yet to actively suggest that the attack didn't come from Vadare - but may have been either state sponsored or rogue group hacking."
It sounds like Vadare has the technology and is the most likely candidate. Cannot be 100 per cent without more info though.,It now sounds like there is another possible candidate. That makes Vadare less likley.
"The computers that are most likely responsible for the cyber attack are found within the Vadere government. While there is no proof that the hackers were backed by the Vadere government, there is also no proof that they weren't acting on their government's orders. Since government computers are often locked down and have restrictions on what employees can and cannot access, in all likelihood the hackers were acting at the request of the Vadere government. ","The CyberChaosCrew are most likely capable of spoofing the location of the attack to make it appear that the attack originated within the Vadere government. It is likely that they did this in order to increase tensions between two neighboring governments. Since it is possible that the attack was by the CyberChaosCrew who are known for targeting governments, it makes it hard for me to be confident that this action was completed by the Vadere government. "
As the cyber attack originated from gouverment computers of a neighbouring country I think it is likely that someone with ranking who would be able to gain access to a controlled or secure building of such. If it wasn?t the gouverment officials themselves there should still be some blame for letting such things happen on their premises,"Although it may have not been vadare officials themselves, their systems should be more secure to prevent such incidents occurring. As they were vulnerable they should still be held partically responsible for letting it happen "
"I believe that the cyber attack was potentially orchestrated by Vadare, mainly because the NCSC traced the computers to Vadare.  I am not 100% certain, as the perpetrator could have been using a proxy server.I would assume that the NCSC took this into account however, and did their due diligence to investigate all aspects of the attack.","It seems my suspicions were most likely correct and the attack was only meant to look like Vadare.  I am less confident that is was Vadare, but I cannot pin it on anyone really, until there is more information. Vadare may have hired the Cyber Crew to perform the attack.  Investigations need to further check into things."
The National Cyber Security Center traced the attacks back to Vadare government computers. However I did was not fully confident as I thought there may be the chance that someone had infiltrated Vadare's system to  frame  them somehow.,Knowledge that the attacks replicate attacks by the cyber attack group further confirms my suspicions that Vadare may have be hacked and  set up . I still believe there is a possibility that the Vadare government are responsible but I have lowered my confidence as I believe there is now a strong chance that they were hacked.
they're the only country that would have interests in attacking this way. i think they have something to benefit. they're also probably experimenting to see what they can get away with.,these hacking attempts are sophisticated and have a lot of money and talent and time behind them. i can't imagine people would do it solely for fun. vadare has the means and the motive for sustained attacks.
"The National Cyber Security Center thinks the attack came from Valdare. Presumably, this government agency would have some expertise to determine the perpetrator. However, maybe they are just looking to find someone to blame. So it is uncertain.",It is possibly the hacktivist group used computers from Valdare to do the attacks. This makes sense. It may not be an official Valdare attach but merely done by groups within the borders.
"I am not sure or not if the attack came from Vadere, But since the attack is on going it needs to be treated seriously. I would need more information to form a better conclusion",I am glad that I did not just assume Vadare of the attack. I would think with the added information that they are not responisble. I need to know where the cyber attack group comes from.
"Because my National Cyber Security Center (NCSC) traced the attack back to government computers operated by the neighboring country, Vadare.",Because of the hacktivist group called the CyberChaosCrew. And that this group has been known to actively target government systems for fun over the last 12 months. 
"The NACS traced the cyber attack from the government of Vadare.  Is there a possibility that the systems of checking this have been tampered with internally, are not reliable or that Vadare have been set up by someone outside of NACS?",This gives more reason to keep an open mind that the culprits of the cyber attack may not be Vadare government.
"The fact the attack was traced back to Vadare means that unless someone could bypass the security services procedures for tracking attacks it had to actually come from Vadare    Accessing the data made it seem logical that the attack came from Vadare.    The disruption caused would most likely benefit Vadare in some way, and it would be important to look into the reasons","The tools where used by a well known group so that needs to be considered    The fact the attack was traced back to Vadare, at the moment shows no evidence that the attack still did not come from there.    It is quite possible that Vadare paid the group money to stage the attack"
"I trust the NCSC to honestly report their findings, so if they say the attack originated on computers within Vadare then I believe them. However just because the computers are located within Vadare, doesn't mean that Vadare's government are necessarily to blame, it could be a 3rd party operating on their territory or a rogue group, hence the lower confidence rating. ","I'd already factored in the prospect of a third party being responsible when providing my earlier confidence rating, so my confidence hasn't dropped significantly, but the new information that these tools match those used by the CuberChaosCrew group has lowered it somewhat. I'll wait to hear whether the match is on superficial details or on a more fundamental level. "
The passage said the attack had been traced to Vadare computers. These folk are not friendly. The attack heightened when air traffic control was affected as well as voting 2 days before.,Additional information suggests the techniques are recognised as being used by CCC. These guys do it for fun. They've been at it for a year. It does not say where they are located or to whom their national allegiance lies.
"The cyber security center traced the attach back to Vadare which is the main reason that I am confident. It seems as though they want to gain control of the air traffic control system in Idimore. They also would be able to gain knowledge of income taxes, voting patterns, etc. of the Idimore people.",I think that Vadare could be working with the cuyber chaos crew. Because they target governmental systems they could easily have been influenced or hired by the leads in Vadare to hack into the system. I could see Vadare using the group so the hacking wouldn't be traced back to them.
"The attack was traced back to Vadare's government computers.  I am confident that this tracing was correct.  Hence, I consider Vadare to be complicit in this cyber-attack.","The new information show that the method's used in this attack, have been used by a hacktivist group. Hence, method alone cannot implicate Vadare in this attack.  However, motive for the attack still suggests that Vadare may well be responsible."
"Based on the vignette it seems likely Vadare is responsible. There was little information provided about Vadare, and no information provided about other threats. With no other information to go on, I will assume Vadare is the culprit. ","I'm not sure where this hacktivist group's allegiances lie. It is entirely plausible that they are working in conjunction with Vadare. If they have a common enemy, they may be allies."
"The NCSC was able to trace the activity back to the government computers of Vadare. As the director of NCSC, I have confidence that our systems are correct in establishing the source of the attack. The problem is on-going so continous assessments of the issue can be made.",The CCC group are notorious for similar attacks therefore it is possible that they have managed to corrupt systems under a false identity. They have acted often within previous months.
The attack was traced back there but there is the possibility that someone could have framed them and made them look guilty  I would want more information before I made my mind up. It is possible that another group wants Vadare to look guilty and take the fall.,There is a history of this group carrying out similar arts is so they have form. They have attacked governments before. It would make sense not to be Vacate as they would be at risk of being found out which would affect any future credibility. They would have too much to lose.
I am the director of the NSCS and the NSCS stated that the attack originated from Vadare. I have no reason to doubt this. I have full confidence in my organisation. ,I have confidence that the NCSC would be aware of the existence of this hacktivist group and have taken it into consideration in their assessment. 
It seems pretty clear the cyber attack came from Vadare. I only have a little bit of doubt about Vadare's role in the attack. It could be a lone hacker or small faction of people working in the government and not the government as a whole.,This confirms the suspicions I had before. I thought there might be a small group of people working within the government that do not represent the government as a whole. The actions of this group do not represent the whole country.
My team has traced the neighbouring country's government as the source of the attack. As head of this company and team I trust my team to accurately do their job and provide factual feedback. I trust that my company has the appropriate resources to be able to establish the source. I'm am not 100% confident though as complicated hacking may show it was the neighbouring country as a diversion tactic.,I am now slightly less confident given this new piece of information. However if my team is still confident that the neighbouring country's government is responsible then as head of this company/team I need to trust their findings.
"I am not sure whether or not the attack came from them as I have not seen the evidence. I would need to see what concrete evidence there is that the attack came from them. Until then, I am making a 50/50 assumption.","Again, I need more information. It could have come from either source. As both are plausible, it would be 50% for each group in terms of possibility."
I feel fairly confident that if the NCSC has decided it has definitely traced the attack back to government computers in Vadare then this must be true. I would feel more confidence if I knew more about the NCSC but I assume as I'm their director they would know to only tell me something was certain if it was. I would be more confident if I had the evidence explained to me.,"The NCSC have not told me otherwise so I fail to see how this new information changes anything. They definitively said they had traced it to governments computers in Vadare, if there was any chance of that being a mistake or falsified they would have said. Though I would be ringing my subordinates to check at this point."
"This neighboring country is making very serious attacks against the voting system. It would be reasonable to assume they are capable of such a similar, significant act. I need more confirmation of the source of this attack before making a stronger assessment. ","This group could be in cahoots with the government. I think that since it was traced to this group it is less likely that the government is involved. Even if the government isn't doing it themselves, they might be funding it. "
"The National Cyber Security Center (NCSC) traced the attack back to government computers operated by our neighboring country, Vadare.","Further forensic analysis has revealed that the tools and techniques used for the cyber-attack are also employed by a hacktivist group called the CyberChaosCrew. This group has been known to actively target government systems for fun over the last 12 months. Therefore, they might well be the group responsible for the attack."
I believe Vadare are those who hacked the system as it was traced back to the computers there. But also I've chose 8 on the scale because there's still a small chance it could be others. For example just because the computers are at that location doesn't mean to say it's not somebody from a different state just using those computers. ,I still stick by my original opinion which is Vadare playing a big part. The new information wasn't clear on where the cyber 'crew' who have been hacking systems for 12 months operate from so Im not going to change my mind
"I am very confident, but not completely confident of Vadare's role in the cyber-attack because while I do not have any reason to doubt the assessment I also understand that it an error is possible and do not know motives in this scenario.","Now that I know there is a possibility that another group would both have the means and motivations to commit this cyber-attack I have more doubt with regard to the earlier assessment. I still do not know the relationship between Idimore and Vadare, so I don't know the political or other motivations that could be present."
"As head of the organization that reported that the attack came from Vadare, I would be in a position to know how good the information was.  I would use my authority to make sure that information was accurate.  Since it is a covert operation there would probably some doubt however. ",First I would want to know why the original assessment was wrong and make improvements. Second I see if there might still be a connection between the hackers and Vadare. Further investigation is warranted.
"intelligence reports and experience may indicate the source of the attacks; however, it is necessary to consider other options too. it could be that another state in the culprit. the fact that voting has been targeted may indicate that a regime change is part of the attack.","given the link with hackers it may be more likely that the attack is linked to possible regime change. alternatively, it could be another state is trying to create chaos and instability to further their own aims."
"The National Cyber Security Centre has determined that the cyber attack has come from the neighbouring state; however, there is no independent data to verify this, and no feedback from Vadare itself.  The NCSC may have an undisclosed reason for citing Vadare as the source of the attack.  Even if the source is Vadare, there is no evidence to suggest who or what entity has created it - if it is on behalf of the state.","There is nothing to suggest that the CyberChaosCrew and Vadare are mutually exclusive.  It could be carried out by them in Vadare, or on behalf of Vadare, or be completely independent.  "
It could easily be done by a third party who wanted to frame Vadare and start a war between us. It is not at all difficult for a skilled cyber terrorist to fake the source of an attack. There needs to be more proof for me to blame Vadare.,"There was no precedent given for Vadare to be hostile to my country. I suspect a group of hackers who like to ruin things for fun could certainly be capable of ruining my country's Internet operations. Given the group's recency (12 months) and usage of similar techniques I would think they are more likely to blame, but there's still no definitive proof. That is why I chose a middle option. Still, there's no reason to believe Vadare is actually culpable even though the attack was traced back to them. "
Attack has been traced back to them,Came from a hacking group - don't know if they are connected to Valdare
several sources have stated that the attack is likely  to come from Vadare; however this is not yet proven.  It is therefore likely but not certain.  More investigation is needed in order to have greater confidence.,"Although the sources state the attack is consistent with Vadare, there is now new information.  The new possible attackers also fit the profile of this hack.  It is therefore another possibility so I am slightly less confident of the involvement of Vadare"
"I am increasingly confident that the current cyber attacks have come from our neighbour Vadare. this is due to the fact that my organisation has traced the attacks back to technology and computer equipment operated and located within the Vadare government. At present, we do not have information positively identifying Vadare government agents committing this action, but the location of the attacking computers points quite decisively at an attack from a foreign government.","There are indications that the attack may have been orchastrated by a hacktivist group to make Vadare look responsible, though further investigation is required."
"The computers are operated from Vadare but that doesn't mean it's definitely come from there, although it seems that they could have been affected by it. They may not have had enough protection against the attack but without more information it's not fact.",None of the additional information points specifically to this country. The further evidence sounds as though it might be a group of  hacktivists  rather than an attack b a country. Nothing indicates the involvement of a specific other country.
The National Cyber Security Centre traced the cyber attack back to computers operated in Vadare.,This throws more light on the situation and suggests that the attack could have been caused by hackers from any origin.
"The information given does not appear to give a particular indication of the motives behind such an attack, therefore it cannot necessarily be assumed that it was the government from Vadere. If the computer information can be traced back to there, that is proof of the geographical origin but not the other motive. The key element would be to establish the motive before assuming guilt.","It seems more likely that this group is the culprit due to past behaviour. There continues to be a lack of obvious motive from the Vadare government. Also, any other motive is also lacking."
The NCSC has traced the source of the cyber attack to Vadare,"The NCSC has since found that the hacktivist group, CyberChaosCrew, use similar tools to those in the possession of Vadare. This raises a number of alternative possibilities i.e. the hack was done for fun by CyberChaosCrew or the Vadare government hired CyberChaosCrew to hack our systems or CyberChaosCrew is actually part of the Vadare government's cyber offense team."
"I am uncertain as I have only received 1 report that it was them. For me this is NOT conclusive proof, this is only an initial guide. With the possibility that the attack could be framing Vadare I could not yet take the risk. I need a second at least independent and impartial company to also investigate. If the attack is sophisticated it may look like it's Vadare but be another terror group trying to create conflict!","I now, as suspected, have information which shows the initial information was suspect. It would be very possible for another to make it look like it is Vadare. It would be so obvious and daft for them to make it so easy to spot. I am still not convinced as they could have asked the hacker group to perpetrate or even be making it look like it's the hacker group. Without more in depth analysis and specialists perhaps checking, it is still uncertain."
"There is a high probability that the attack came from Vadare because most government computers are secure and difficult to hack into. Also, if this attack has been on going, Vadare would have given a statement as to the hacking of their systems. Also, they would not have let it go on for this amount of time without addressing the issue. If Vadare is not responsible directly then they are complicit by allowing it to go on for this long.",This adds a face to the mystery but I am not convinced that Vadare is in the clear as of yet. There are many things that they can do to at least temporarily halt the cyber-attack. Shutdown affected computers and use backups is one solution. I knocked down my initial grade because the hacking group has a history and could very well be acting alone.
I?m director of the ncsc so I am confident that my staff have done a good job in tracing the source. It seems plausible given our current relations. I?m also keen to maintain my position so it helps to show success,Now I have new information it?s only right to reconsider the results. Even if I have confidence in my staff we need to ensure we have correct data
"There isn't enough proof for me to assume that it is Vadare. It's only a speculation, which is something that could end up being wrong later. I'm a firm believer in innocent until proven guilty, and Vadare hasn't been proven to be guilty.","Now that there is sufficient evidence, I can assume that it was Vadare. I'm not completely certain as it could just be a coincidence, but there is enough evidence for me to be suspicious. I highly doubt that it is a coincidence though."
It appears that they never took the necessary precautions like we did with regards to cyber attacks. We have invested heavily in a new system and with the NCSC very confident it also came from vadare.,There could now be a slight possibility that the cause could have came from CC crew as evidence seems to point to the fact they like to target new government systems 
The NCSC made the determination. They have better resources and tools than i do. They have the educational background to make the decisiln,The new information definitely changes my perspective. However it is possible it was directed by others or the result of hiring the collective. It would depend on the interplay of information
"In the previous text no proven facts were provided to convince me that Vadare was unequivocally responsible.  Therefore, I have no proof either way as to who is the culprit.  I would need more evidence in such a high profile incident.","The new evidence looks to clear Vadare of responsibility.  However, again this does not seem to be definite."
cyber attacks have been traced back to Vadare by own specialists,additional information received brings into doubt to a certain extent that the attack has come from Vadare but could be people who are able to disguise exact location 
Sometimes a government can make a country look guilty even though they're not. That's why I don't trust the security team 100%. Another foreign government could have set up Vadare to make them look guilty and start a war between the countries. That's why I'll give Vadare the benefit of the doubt.,The cyber group could be trying to start a war between the countries. I wouldn't blame Vadare even if the hackers came from their country. It's not the same as the government doing bad things. It's just members of the public.
I am fairly confident that it was Vadare who launched the cyber attack. The teams had traced the source of the attack back to that region. ,This new information doesn't really change my view. 
The analysis inferred that the attack originated in Vadare and that seems to make sense.,It seems as though a different group may have been framing Vadare for their own ends.
They have conducted an investigation and found that the source of the attack was traced back to the neighbouring countries Vadare Government computers. Therefore as the attack came directly from the source one should be right to believe they were the instigators. ,"Whilst the attack came from the neighbouring country  Vadare's government computers, it is possible that the attack was done by hackers. This is because they use similar technology to Vadare - it's hard to decide who is the culprit. "
"I am not confident, because we only had a suspected cyber-attack, per the vignette, not a confirmed cyber-attack. Additionally, whatever we are calling a cyber-attack was traced back to Vadare, but I have no evidence as to what we traced back, where in Vadare it is, and why we believe it's a cyber-attack. Thus, I'm not confident, but there's evidence that Vadare has at least been involved in our system.","I don't know how widely used these tools are, and there's nothing that mentions that Vadare is related to this hacktivist group. Additionally, just because the hacktivist group uses these tools does not mean they employed them this time."
The vignette suggested that the attack originated in Vadare and that it was aimed at critical systems in Idimore. I have not indicated that I am very confident as I have not had an opportunity to review the evidence or rule out that the attack was carried out by someone else.,"The new information suggests an alternate source of the attack, however there is no information provided on this source. I do not know if this is an international organisation or if it is an organisation with significant membership in Vadare. The new information complicates the situation, but does not provide clarity."
I feel that we need to trust the information supplied by the National Cyber Security Center. It is possible that our information is wrong and that the attack came from another source either within or outside Idimore so there is some room for doubt. However without any other information to go on it is most likely that the NCSC is correct and the attack is from Vadare. The fact that this happened during an election suggests that it is indeed the government of Vadare and that they are trying to influence the results of the election for their own benefit. ,The fact that the same tools are used by the hacktavist group does make it slightly more likely that the info from the National Cyber Security Center is incorrect. However this is a very serious attack involving air traffic control systems as well as tampering with the election so I find it unlikely that it is just an ordinary group of hackers. I still find it most likely that it is from the hostile government of Vadare.
The government computers that were hacked were controlled by vadare ,If they can get into government computers and hack them it may have been made to look like vadare but there computers would of been hacked 
"This sounds like a pretty damning description. I'd say you should never be 100% sure (especially from only one source) that everything is as it seems at face value. It could be that another country orchestrated the attack and framed Vadare by leaving a false trail. It could be that someone part of the Vadare government acting individually or as a small radical group orchestrated the attack. That being said, Occam's Razor says we should be quite confident.","I'm not entirely sure that forensic evidence is actually a thing when investigating computer crime, I thought that was only fingerprints, tiremarks, and such. My gut feeling is to be slighly less confident in my convictions, but to want to do further research on the credibility of the source.  This could be misinformation from Vadare. Additionally, the group could have been working in collaboration with Vadare's government. The Hacktivist group executing the attack doesn't mean Vadare is blameless."

The ongoing series of incidents involving this country as circumstantial evidence. The tracing of the attack to servers in Vadare would also suggest the attack came from them. I would be cautious of being completely sure about accusing this country until more evidence was available.,This new evidence would indicate that Vadare might have been a cover  for the attack. It would seem possible that it was being framed by the hacktivists. There also might be a chance that this was misinformation.
The attack fits with previous attacks from Vadare. But we have no concrete proof that this latest attack is definitely from Vadare. Therefore I am not very confident about this.,We can't be confident that Vadare is behind the attack if it came from CyberChaos Crew. It is possible that Vadare are paying or giving support to this group but we have no proof of this. The cyber attack fits with CyberChaosCrew's previous 12 months of activity
I am quite confident that Vadare is behind this cyber attack as we traced the attack back to the Vadare government computers. However we dont know if that attack was made by an individual or was from the government. However as we know all about Vadare in previous disputes the n it is very likely they were responsible.,The fact that activist group was actually behind the attack does not preclude responsbility for Vadare as they may have contacts with this group so I am still confident it could be still be Vadare who was behind this attack.
"If you assume you make an ass out of you and me. Before assuming that the cyber attacker was from Vadare, I would find out a bit more information. ",The new information does not tell me where the attackers are from. 
"I am confident that the cyber attack came from Vadare given how it has been traced back to computers stationed across the border. However, it is harder to say who exactly may be behind this.Given Vadare's capabilities for conducting cyber attacks and the current political situation between the two neighbours it must be seen as a clear possibility that the Vadare government is guilty. The questioning of our government's legitimacy by Vadare's president has laid a foundation upon which hostile actions may be conducted and the ongoing elections  have perhaps provided a trigger. However, the possibility that a rogue element within Vadare lies behind the cyber attack cannot be ruled out. Additionally, just because it has been launched from Vadare does not mean its funding/planning cannot have been conducted elsewhere.","Within my last assessment I had already considered the fact that a rogue element within Vadare may have been behind the attack, the new information seems to confirm the likelihood of this. This confirmation raises the possibility of the attack having a broader geographic origin than just Vadare and my lessening of confidence reflects this. The relationship between the activist hacking group and the Vadare government is not yet clear however. Furthermore, it still stands that the attack originated from computers in Vadare."
The security organisation has found links to Vadare and there has been lots of talk from Vadare about our country. I am not convinced it is necessarily from the government as I would need more actual proof. It is possible that someone in Vadare is responsible but not necessarily that the government is actually involved. I do not know what the Vadare government response is to the problem.,I do not know if the Vadare government is supportive of the CCC group or has any influence or dealings with it. I cannot be sure that the Vadare government is involved and would need more information about the group and other attacks they have carried out.
"Vadare has a vested interest in the election, having publicly supported a political system known for a severe lack of moral rectitude. The country has a history of performing similar attacks in the past. This coupled with a history of invasion suggests the attack on airtraffic control is an extension of the election disruption, possibly preparation for invasion if the election tampering is unsuccessful. However the vignette contains no details of the rest of the world stage. It would be possible for a third country interested in disrupting region for their own gains to spoof the attack and make Vadare appear guilty","There was always a possibility that the attack was spoofed, however it is still possible that the organisation responsible is sponsored by Vadare. There would need to be further investigation into the financial and political backgrounds of the individuals involved. This might be an 'independent' group being influenced by one or two agents of Vadare on only a few occasions"
The attack was traced back to Vardare by Idimore's National Crime Security Centre. Given there has been a series of disputes between both countries it was highly likely Vardare was the origin of the attack. The National Crime Security Centre investigation proved this was the case. ,"My previous assessment still stands. The National Cyber Security Security Centre traced the attack to Vadare. The investigation was highly likely to discover Vadare was the origin given the tension between the two countries, mainly instigated by Vadare whose sole intention is to take over Idimore. "
I am confident of Vadare role in this attack as they previously caused problems to us. They always pursue   have Both Idimore and Vadare have been involved in a series of disputes in the past that are often initiated by Vadare. Vadare is known to pursue thing with any means necessary. They have also shown support for a far right candidate who may not have got in power so the cyber attack would have helped.  ,Given new evidence it seems that vadare did not do the cyber attack. however the attack would have helped their preferred candidate. Also from previous experiences they would have seemed to have done this
"It is very likely, based on previous experience and knowledge, that Vadare are behing the cyber attack.  They have motive for it, and as they have done it before, they obviously have the skills.  However, there does not seem to be, as far as I have read, and actual positive proof that they commited the cyber attack, so there is the small possibility it could be someone else.","Less confident that it was Vardare given the new in formation, but I still don't know where this hactivist group came from, or how they are funded, or of they have been given information by Vadare to help target my country.  So Vardare could still be ultimately behind the attack."
Vadare usually initiate disputes so they have this going against them. NCSC traced the attack back to Vadare which substantiates they would have had something to do with it. Perhaps the cyber attack would also have been in their favour and so they had motive. ,The fact there is a  crew  out there who could have done this and would have a vested interest in doing this supports the theory. As they have given themselves a name and have history it sounds as though they would be open and proud of any attack that has taken place. 
"Given the current situation between the two countries, and the fact that the attack was traced to two computers in Vadare, they are obviously suspect. However, if an organization is advanced enough to take over a country's systems like this, who's to say they're not a third party that has taken over these computers in Vadare and then proceeded to attack our systems? Somewhat unlikely, but no one can say for sure.","These cyber organisations are usually made up from anonymous people potentially all around the globe, it is very hard to pinpoint who they are made up out of. It could have been done out of support for Vadare, but it could also be to harm them due to this harming their image. "
"It stated in the vignette that evidence to date indicates that the attack was started in the neighboring country.  I would have to assume that this information is reliable .  There is a history of troubles between the two countries so an attack like this is not our of the question.  Also with the support from Vadare's president for a New far right leader in the upcoming elections it would provide a potential motive for the attack, looking to cause disruption and potential regime change.","The information update didn't say where the cyber group are based or come from, just that they are known to carry out attacks on governments.  For this reason I couldn't say confidently whether the attack came from Vadare or not.  To do that more information is needed about the grouo, their past attacks and motives."
"There is an ongoing bitter dispute between my country Idimore and the neighbouring country Vadare, who have made no secret of their wish to disrupt the running of our country. This extends to their support for a far right wing political candidate who wishes to topple the existing government. It would be within Vadare's scope to orchestrate a cyber attack on Idimore for their own ends and it is therefore highly likely that they are behind it.","Although the cyber attack was shown to have come from CyberChaosCrew, I am still unconvinced that Vadare are not utlimately responsible, as perhaps they have paid CyberChaosCrew to undertake the attack as they have the IT knowledge to do this."
"Vadare is known to do cyberattacks and seems keen to undermine Idimore.However, no evidence has been produced that categorically proves that Vadare is responsible.  So, overall, it seems likely but it isn't proved.",It seems that there is evidence that a hacktivist group called  CyberChaosCrew  is responsible rather than Vadare.   CyberChaosCrew  are known to do theor atatcks for fun rather than politically motivated purposes.
Vadare is currently showing support for a particular candidate in the current campaign and challenging the current administration. They have continual experience in this kind of act and appear to be using this to challenge the administration. Therefore it is highly likely that they are the culprits of this attack in a bid to cause issues for the current election and administration.,"The new information suggests that this is being done by a group for fun, although it is unclear as to where these come from. It also could have been paid by Vadare to carry out the attackes, however there is now a level of uncertainty and evidence to confirm either way. Therefore the confidence level has reduced and further investigation would be required."
The vignette suggests Vadare has a history of cyber attacks and that they tend to be the orchestrator of most disputes between the two countries. The timing of this when Vadare are showing support for the new far right presidential candidate also points towards their responsibility ,"I have downgraded my answer slightly given the new information relating to the hacktivist group. However, I still feel Vadare should not be ruled out given the history between the two countries. I would also not rule out the possibility of Vadare working with or recruiting the hacktivists. "
Based on the evidence provided in the scenario I would feel slightly confident of the likelihood that Vadare was responsible for the cyber-attack. Their support of the far right candidate and their public support of them and their comment that they would go to whatever means necessary to see this candidate successful provide a basis with which to believe they would be responsible. There is no concrete evidence that Vadare was responsible for the attach and this would need to be made clear to the president when explaining the situation. I would need to investigate any causla links but also not restrict the investigation to Vadare being the only suspect of the attacks as it is likely that other organisations would have motive to commit this type of crime. Whilst Vadare has clear motive it would not be sufficient to deem them guilty based on the current level of evidence.,Given the new evidence I would be not very confident at all that Vadare  was responsible for the attack. There is a slight chance that the Vadare colluded with the organisation that took responsibility for the attack and this is why I did not provde the response of 1 in the question above. I decided to change my earlier assessment given the evidence that does not support the basis that Vadare was souly responsible for the attack. 
There is a long standing rivalry between our two countries with frequent attacks instigated by Vadare. A constant threat is posed by this country and they are openly hostile towards us. ,The attack may be sponsored by Vadare so I cannot rule out their partcipation. 
The fact that they are part of a far right uprising.,"The new information adds doubt, but there is still a likelihood that either Vadare are still behind it or this is a cover up. "
"  I would be angry, but I think that the attack must be verified, WHO made the attack",  I will not change my attitude because I learned that the attack was done by another group
I have no other information from any source that another country/source is another candidate foe the cyber-attack. A long-standing political feud may be a reasonable basis to draw inference. It may be possible that it is not Vadare. As a air-traffic control director I would not be a specialist in the veracity of the evidence from the cyber-attack.,Although we now have the name of the cyber-hacktivists it does not clarify which country they are from. Their own statement makes it sound like they are not acting upon their country's best interests but against governments in general. This does not guarantee that some individuals with knowledge around them who may have contributed to the success of the cyber-attack did not have a government-biased agenda.
The cyber attack seems to fit Vadare's modus operandi and is similar to previous attacks. They have an obvious motive in destabilising the current government by causing confusion and uncertainty amongst the general population though their attacks. They have shown support for a right wing candidate and seem to be pushing them as an alternative to a helpless liberal government. That there have been past attacks usually instigated by Vadare they seem to have an anatagonistic view towards my country and act aggresively. There is no other clear culprit behind the attacks. ,"The new information is interesting and provides some doubt on the current suggestion but doesn't neccesarily prove that Vadare isn't behind the attacks. Even if not directly behind the group, they could be recieving support (financial or otherwise) from Vadare. Even if there are no direct goals behind the groups actions the chaos that they are causing is beneficial to Vadare's overall aims of destabilising the country and creating confusion. "
Past attacks by vadare  Intention to disrupt government and support new candidate.    Of course I didn't score 10 as there is a chance the attack came from elsewhere but the likelihood is high.,There is still a chance the forensic analysis is wrong.    The cyber attack group may have worked with Vadare.    I would need more information to eliminate vadare from suspicion.
"Vadare has motivation to disrupt the elections as the president wants to influence in favour of his preferred candidate. Vadare has previous form for such activities. I am not completely confident however as there has not been a discussion of the evidence available to show it was Vadare, it seems very likely though.","Vadare still seem likely to have had some influence - the previous information does not say which country the hacktivist group come from. However, it does seem that this group could be acting independently from the country, particularly if they have form for this behaviour."
Vadare has a history of aggressive behaviour. Vadare openly supports one candidate over another in the election. A climate of fear makes people more likely to vote conservative/right-wing and hence the attack suits Vadare's preferences.,"The attack still benefits Vadare and they may have sponsored it. However, it will be difficult to prove that the attack originated from Vadare - the hacker group is unlikely to admit if they were acting under direction or off their own bat."
The attack has been traced to Vadare and they seem to have motive for this. They also are known to act in a dishonest manner so I would believe that they are responsible.,New information has come to light that it is not Vadare and is a group of non-affiliated hackers.
Cyber company tracing back to vadare  History of conflict between towns,Still have to take into consideration the previous information however have to take new information in. The new information leads us to believe that the new group could be responsible as they have done this recently
Its likely that they would be responsible . All avenues should be sought to investigate this before accusing them.Care should be taken not to over react at such a sensitive time. ,They could be involved with this group but it is unlikely.Further investigation would still be needed.No statement needs to be issued from the government at this point.
"Because the National cyber security centre said they traced the attack back to goverment computers from vadare. With national elections and  vadare being known in pursuing all means possible to military across border,trade tactics well as cyberattacks. And with the president vadare putting support behind a candidate for presidency he said questioned wether the administration in office was legitimate.My only doubt is with the cyber attack attacking air traffic systems.",Based on the new information that forensic analysis that group called cyber chaos crew was responsible for the attack and they have been known 12 months to target goverment systems. The blame on vadare is less confident than before. But small doubt because I do not know where cyber chaoes crew originate from.
I'm fairly confident due to the amount of history behind the relationship and seemingly the deterioration and escalation of negative actions Vadare has taken on Idimore. Also the president of Vadare is being quite blatant with his opinions on the current administration which would support them wanting to rail road a campaign and promote someone they believe to better.,"Although it's been identified that a hacktivist group is more than likely responsible, there is no evidence on the motivation of this group. The group could easily be working with Vadare government or even been employed by the government."
Based on the folowing facts: 1. ongoing trade dispue 2. military ops/incursions 3. ongoing cyber attacks 4. Interference/influence via the backing of the far-right candidate in elctions. Conclude that the attack on the ATC is down to Valdare but would need further evidence,If cyber forensics indicate it is actually the hacktivists then the original view must be reassessed. Therefore it becomes less likely that it was indeed Valdare. However Valdare could be sponsoring the hackitivst group so cannot be ruled out.
"The previous history of Vadare's behaviour would suggest they are the culprit, also, there support of a rival candidate. However, one cannot rule out other possibilities- another country or even elements within our own country.","If the evidence points to this new group, then that would seem the likely source. However, one cannot rule out the possibility that Vadare maybe using this group or doing the attacks themselves disguised as this group."
Vadare has engaged in cyber attacks previously and has indicated they have an interest in interfering in our elections to promote a far right candidate. Our security agency has traced the cyber attacks to Vadare.,"New information indicates the cyber attack was from an independent group of hackers. However, it is still possible that Vadare may have a connection with the attack and is using this group as a cover, so while I am less confident it is Vadare, I do not rule it out."
"There is significant previous activity from Vadare that would suggest that this is not above their level. They have shown willing to wave border laws and other national security measures and have, as such, shown open hostility towards my country. The elections and air traffic disruptions seem a likely target form Vadare","It is possible that Vadare have used this group as a scapegoat for their activity or may have them helped to infiltrate. That said, the hacktivist group have shown that they are capable of this type of activity before and could well be the only source of this attack"
Theres a possibility that its vadare since they are known for using cyber attacks. There are lots of other potential countries that it could be however so its not fair to say that its definitely Vadare. The fact that they are questioning the current administrations legitimacy and have just expressed interest for a far riht candidate seems like it is probably more than just a coincidence however. ,It says it came from the hacktavist group and the fact that they are actavists gives me no reason to think that the country would have arranged it. I wouldn't say that they definitely didnt though so I put the bar at a 2.
The evidence obtained shows that Vadare are the culprit and all the benefits of the attack are to them. ,I am not less sure as a group has taken responsibility. They could have been paid or encouraged by the other country. There is a good chance that this group has claimed responisbility but it did not actually carry out the attacks.
"If Vadare is supporting a different candidate and is not happy with our position at the moment, plus already being known to participate in these types of attacks, then I believe them to definitely be responsible for this attack.","A lot of hacker groups in society do these things for 'fun', however, a lot of these types of groups are also known to take 'credit' for things that they have not actually done. I find it 50/50 that Vadare may be letting someone else take credit for this."
Vadare has been involved in several disputes with Idimore and when i look at their past actions where they have used cyber attacks in the past it's clear that they have now target our governments computers. Their presidents support for the far right candidate in our upcoming election also strengthens my belief that they are behind the cyber attacks.,I am still not 100% certain that Vadare are not behind the attacks and i would need to investigate more to make sure that CyberChaosCrew were not told to do it by the Vadare government.
Vadare do anything they can to benefit themselves. The two countries are known rivals. There are no other suspects.,"Hacktivist groups are very prominent and often strike when unexpected. If it's been reported that they did it and there's sufficient proof, I would believe it."
"Vadare is known to use these attacks. Vadare has the motivation to undermine our stability. However, the possibility of other actors should not be excluded, including attempts to scapegoat Vadare.",The evidence is reportedly strong that CCC carried out the attacks. CCC looks like a politically independent group. However they may be backed by foreign powers.
"I am basing this assumption on the previous statement, Vadare has a history of attacks and so this would fit with this hostile relationship. ",We now have the identity of the perpetrators but do not know the relationship between them and Vadare. Are they from there? Or were they hired by Vadare to implement the attack. It still seems more likely than not that Vadare are responsible but the question is open to is this just a random attack   
"Vadare seems it would be an easy target to scapegoat for the attack, there may be other groups of people wanting to disrupt the elections within or outside of our own country. If Vadare really cared about getting a right wing candidate in then they wouldn't disrupt the election process, they would instead help that candidate push his agenda and achieve more media coverage, if however the feeling was they wanted to disrupt processes to weaken the country generally then I would be more sure they were the cause behind the attack. ","There are so many unknowns. A hacktavist group wouldn't normally leave trails so they may have wanted it to seem like Vadare was instructing them, however Vadare may have infrastructure to carry out the attack. So Vadare could still be behind the attack, although less certain than before."
"It sounds to me like a re-telling of the current USA/Russia situation - and I would not put my money on a 400lb guy in someone's basement over Russia. Having said that - there's a historical record of interference by Vadere in the country, so they would be the most likely suspect. I would also want to see proof before making a final decision though.","Confidence down - but having said that I would also want further information about this group of hackers and any possible links (were the hackers being manipulated in terms of targets chosen, etc)."
it was traced back their country. there is previous history of cyber-attacks there. they have been in a feud for a long time.,i believe this group is from vadare based on all the previous information. there is no reason to not think its vadare. there is no other eveidence
"A dare is looking to undermine the current administration. One way of doing this is by creating disruption to people’s daily lives, instilling fear and then promoting a more authoritarian way of dealing with the situation which is likely to be more black and white.",Because the statement was clear that it was a particular group. In the face of evidence I would not persist with my own view. However I would want to have very clear evidence.
"Vadare has a history of cyber attacks on Idimore in addition to other activities which have caused distress, embarrassment and disruption to Idimore. Vadare wants to overthrow the government and  install its own far right candidate to the Presidency. The strategy is to undermine the populaton's confidence in the current government and subvert the country.",The strategists at Vadare could well have utilised CyberchaosCrew's technical knowledge and experience to undertake this cyber attack. This may or may not have been with CyberchaosCrew's knowlege or cooperation. 
Information has been provided that the Cyber Attack originated from computers based in the country of Valdare.  In trying to 'prove' that these were controlled by citizens of Valdare I would point out the prevous history between our country and Valdare particularly highlighting the previous cyber attacks which have been proven as originating in this country.  I would have to mention the slight doubt that even due to previous history there is an outside chance that a new threat had entered the arena and was responsible for this latest attack; but would stress this was highly unlikely and I would be gathering enough hard evidence to report back as soon as possible to try and discount this anomoly.,I am changing my assessment as the highlighted group which has now been proven to be behind the latest cyber attack does not have links with Valdare stated; in fact there is no further information about links from this group to any country and therefore it is definate that further research and evidence gathering is needed.
Given the info provided it is more than likely that the attack came from Vadare given their political beliefs and also because of the timing of the incident.,I would feel that although the hack didn’t originate from Vadare directly it is feasible that Vadare could have contacted the hackers to provide the funds in purchasing the hackers.
The historical hostility from Vadare makes them the obvious candidate for the cyber attack. Their past behaviour suggests that this would be something that Vadare would carry out. Interfering in the voting process might also further their agenda in supporting the far-right candidate - though without further details I am unsure how.,"The CyberChaosCrew might be indigenous to Imidare (?). They sound generally anti-Government, be it Imidare or Vadare. Not sure."
Past disputes initiated by Vadare show they have previous form for starting conflict. Vadare had previously engaged in cyber attacks specifically. Vadare has questioned the legitimacy of the current government.These points make Vadare a likely suspect but without evidence we can not be entirely sure of their role.,"The new information challenges the assumption that Vadare were involved. However, there is no information on the motivation for the cyber attack and several parties could be involved. Without proof that they weren't involved, based on previous conflicts Vadare would remain a suspect until they can be ruled out."
"Given the history of relations, the political views of the country and the fact that someone from Vadare was trying to be elected, it appears a cyber attack would work by possibly affecting the results of the election.",The new information does not change my opinion. The group are probably operating from Vadare and I have no reason to believe otherwise.  It would also seem strange that they would do this for fun.
"Vadare is known to have carried out attacks involving cyber issues on previous occasions. An election would be a good opportunity to carry out another attack in order to disrupt proceedings and get its point across about the validity of the election, giving it a chance to promote the far-right candidate.","Although this group also has form for this sort of attack, I'm not convinced that it would want to cause quite the chaos that has been caused, despite its name. Vadare potentially has more to gain by the attack - or at least to cause problems for Idimore."
"Given the hostile nature of Vadare, it would fit the pattern of attacks that we have come to expect from them. We cannot rule out any other parties but it would be wise to keep an eye on Vadare.","It is unclear where this group originates from but it would still be too early to rule out Vadare in the attack. Many groups are known to claim attacks that they are not involved in and so we now have 2 suspects to focus on, leaving me completely split between the two."
"The evidence has been provided that geographically it came from there, but i have no evience who was responsible as i know data can be rerouted across borders, and even if it did originate in Vadare, I cannot be sure it is a Vadare citizen, let alone if it is Vadare government sanctioned attack. It could even be an agent provocotuer from my own country hoping to inrease tensions, or prevent electronic tampering by forcing lowtech election processes","Again the lines are blured, just because it seems to hae been a hackitivist group does not mean they were not influenced or infiltrated by other agencies. It does not mention whether the group is located/affiliated with either my country or Vadare"
"The history between the two areas would lead me to believe this, the fact they favour a particular candidate for power of this area.",The group could be based anywhere however the history between the two areas still arises suspicion
"Vadare would be the most likely as they have been meddling in the countries affairs via cyber attacks and air traffic etc. Although, there would need to be evidence to prove it",The activist group could equally be from Vadare or somewhere else. 
They are known for this type of thing  They are backing a right wing candidate  They may be trying g to fix the ballot in the candidates favour,The activist group may just be claiming for attention  vadare are known for this type of thing  They have more to gain
"Vadare are know for dirty trick including previous cyber attacks, this wold make it highly likely that they were behind the attack. Although to be absolutely sure you would need further investigation","While further information has shown that an activist group was behind the attack, it is quite possible they could have been paid or otherwise coerced into the attack by Vadare. So a full investigation would be required in order to find the truth"
"I would guess that the cyber attack came as a deliberate attempt to undermine the current government of my country, display their security flaws and weaknesses. The motive behind doing this would be, I would suppose, to attempt to sway the electorate towards a more right wing party, who tend to have harsher attitudes towards defense, funding for defense and nationalism. ","Under this new light, I would say perhaps the independent Cyber attack group have affiliations or their own political leanings and influences, but Vadare can not be blamed accurately or factually."
"There has been a series of disputes with Vadare in the past which gives credence to the idea that they may be responsible. The political statements of the neighbour also supports this view.  Though not stated, it is probable that the source of the interference can be traced but so far this has not been proved which is why I cannot score the probability higher than 7.  It is also possible that an internal candidate who fears losing the election has manipulated the system possibly with the help of Vadare.","I have changed my view as it would appear that it is a group independent of the Vadare government who have done this just for the fun of it.  Nevertheless, the group could still be from neighbouring Vadare and the Vadare government could have funded or encouraged the group."
I strongly believe the attack came from Valdare as it was traced back to the computers of the government of Valdare and they have a history of intrusions into the business of other countries.,It is still possible that the cyber attack came from Valdare itself as the hacking group - whilst known to infiltrate the computers of various governments for fun - have not claimed responsibility in this incident so it does not preclude Valdare from being the attacker. 
As mentioned Vadare has been involved in questionable activities against Vigenette in the past.  This would lead me to belive they are also involved this time around to ensure there preffered candidate is elected so they can purse there own agenda.,"Although a hacking group have been identified, they could be coordinating with valdare "
Due to the historical evidence of Vadare's attacks on Idimore it is highly likely that they are responsible for the present ongoing cyber attack. The fact that Vadare has openly supported a far right candidate in the elections and is questioning the legitimacy of the government is further proof that it is highly likely that Vadare is responsible for the current cyber attack.,"The new information shows that although Vadare is trying to meddle in the affairs of Idimore, it is not responsible for the cyber attack. The hacktavist group which shows no political affiliations, hacks governments for fun and has no bias towards supporting  Vadare in their attempts to disrupt Idimore's infrastructure and government."
"I think it certainly could be that the attack was perpetrated by Vadare, they seem to have some motive to carry out this attack. However, there is no conclusive evidence that they are to blame and when governing a country, diplomacy, especially when dealing with neighbours, is paramount. ",It was proven that the cyber attack originated from another group who are known to carry out these kind of attacks for entertainment. Therefore I no longer beleiev Vadare is likely to be to blame. 
"Vadare is renowned for using underhand tactics to get what it wants, and has a history of smearing its neighbours as well as conducting cyber attacks and interfering with potential presidential candidates for Idimore.  There appears to be no denial of said tactics.  As no other possible perpetrators are suggested, one can only assume with a high degree of confidence that Vadare is behind the current cyber attack.  It also has not denied it.","I still suspect Vadare is behind the attack as it has a history of cyber attacks on Idimore.  If it weren't responsible, it would be highly likely that they would deny such an attack.  However, now that a cyber-hacking group has claimed responsibility and said they did it  for fun,  then it slightly lessens my suspicions that it was carried out on behalf of Vadare."
"There has been a history of tensions with Vadare and an escalating crisis in the relationship. Whilst we cannot prove 100 per cent currently that the attack came from Vadare, the finger of suspicion is very much at them but I have rated it above average but not certain that they did it. The world is an increasingly hostile place and the threat may be coming from elsewhere  a state or a lone wolf individual. We need more evidence that it was Vadare. ",We do not yet know where the Cyber Attack Group come from. They sound like an activist organisation and potentially not from Vadare so we need more evidence. This is why I have rated it 50/50 - we just don't know at the moment. 
I have been told of this and they have history of this.  I would like more information and evidence.  I would like to speak to their head,Now there is more information coming about the attack.  I would like to know if it is reliable.  Or if it is from Vadare
I am confident Vadare are responsible for the cyber attack as I have faith in the NCSC and believe them when they say where the attack came from. Vadare are also known to have been in dispute with Idimore and are known to pursue their own interests at any cost. They are known to support a certain candidate in the upcoming election and therefore would have an interest in causing upset.,"I changed my earlier assessment as further analysis has shown that CyberChaosCrew are responsible. These people hack systems for fun, not because they are in dispute with the country involved. They are a known group who have carried out such attacks before so it is feasible they are responsible."
"Historical aggressive policies from Valdare, Support for a candidate in the election.The close proximity of the country",Another group claims responsibility but they could be operating under instructions from Vadare.
Vadare uses any means to achieve their goals. They are trying to get a far right candidate elected. They have been known to use cyber attacks,"New info says CCC did the attack. It doesn't say their nationality. Also says they attack for fun, not to achieve political Goals"
"Vignette focuses heavily on relationship between Idimore and Vadare without any suggestion of any other source for cyber-attack. Statements made regarding Vadare’s previous behaviours are not supported by evidence. Due to the nature of the attack, it is possible that the perpetrator is only a single individual not related to the government and has skills to make it appear the source is the Vadare government.","No mention of where the group responsible originates from so cannot say 100% that they are not from Vadare. This does not rule out possible collusion between the group and the government, but presenting an alternative suspect in the cyber attack inevitably lowers confidence in the guilt of one suspect."
"Vadare has been implicated in cyber-attacks on our country in the past and so this would lead me to believe that they are most likely the culprits of this current attack. The fact that they have expressed their support for an opposition party seems suspicious. In addition, the fact that they are interfering with our aviation systems shows that the culprit has motive to disrupt travel and even military services in an attempt to create confusion, affect the economy and to potentially catch the country unawares.",Vadare still has motive to carry out a cyber-attack but the new evidence does show that it may have come from another group. This group is reported to carry out cyber-attacks for fun but could still be in co-operation with Vadare. It is unclear at this point if Vadare could still be involved.
"It is possible that Vadare caused the attack, but this is only based on past behaviour. There is no certain evidence at present to prove that Vadare caused it. I would want to see more evidence to be certain.","The forensic evidence shows that the CyberChoasCrew caused the attack. It would appear that this is a group doing it for fun rather than political reasons. It is not clear from the evidence which country CyberChoasCrew is based in, therefore it is difficult to say whether the attack came from Vadare. However, given the evidence at present, it suggests that it was not initiated by Vadare's government."
There is s history of conflict and vadare have previously used this method as well as others to cause disruption. Also the far right candidate has caused further tension. ,I don't know what the new evidence actually is. Could it be organisation posing as vadare as it was originally traced back to government computers in their country? I'm split now.
Vadare has a vested interested in our elections as their president supports a far right candidate in our elections. They also have a history of cyper crime against us. Their proximity and access to cypercrime technology makes targetting us easier for them,"There is concrete forensic proof that this organisation were behind the attacks. There is no evidence that they come from Vadare, and appear to be an anti-government organisation so they would not be working with the vadare government. They appear to have attacked us for ‘fun’ rather than political motives"
"Information suggested it came from government computers. It could be a plot against them, though this would be more like if the source was a residential area rather than government.",A more likely suspect has been identified who particularly target the government. So they may seem more likely now.
It has been traced back to Vadare but it may not mean it is necessarily them,"It is possible for someone to hack another system to use it to hack something else, it would need to be investigated further to see it this is the root cause"
"The National Cyber Security Centre traced the attack to computers based in Vadare. This means the attackers were based in that country, although not necessarily citizens. It does not mean that Vadare sanctioned the attack, but the question asks did it come from Vadare. Of course, computers can be rerouted through numerous servers world wide but I would expect a National Security Centre to be fairly competent and therefore assume if they tracked the attack to there, that is where it came from.","Again, my assessment is that the attack came physically from Vadare, but as I said in the earlier answer, it does not suggest that it was sanctioned by the Vadarian Government or even performed by citizens of that country."
Because it appeared to originate from there and they appear to be hostile towards us.,"Because the hackers are known to hack for fun, not for political reasons. However, it was still traced back to Valdare, so the hacking group could have been made up of people from that country."
"Although these were traced to the country, VPNs and other such can be used to fake this. there is not enough evidence to confirm this .",a hacking group like this could very well mask their location and could be located anywhere. They would be likely to do this to stir up trouble.
"Whilst there are suspicions that this is the case, there is no evidence that proves it so I would rather be open minded than put the blame somewhere unfairly. ",Because the attack has been proven to come from a different Hacktivist group. That would mean that Vadare were not to blame and didn’t cause the attack. 
Because it said it was them in the post.,because it said that it was a activist group doing it for fun in the previous post. ChaosCrew or something similar.
"Unlike parts of this country, I believe our intelligence community when they provide compelling evidence a foreign power is out to get us. ","Based on the lack of detail, there's still reason to believe it was Vadare. Is the hacker group part of them or independent? Is there evidence they were put up to it by Vadare? "
Evidence shows that the cyber attack origined from Vadare according to the previous text. It is possible to have an attack from a neighbouring country so it increases the fact that the attack came from Vadare because the condition of a neighbouring country and political view can affect the other neighbouring countries. ,"It maybe an artificial information created by the Vadare to decrease the tension between countries. Additionally, the report says that this group is active for a long time. It is not too possible for a country couldn't solve this problem for that long time. When all possibilities taken into consideration, it is more likely that a fake information created by Vadare. But, I didn't choose 1 on the scale because trusting the neighbour country is a must to have a more relaxed environment. "
The tracing of the Cyber Attack was completed by the National Security Services. In my opinion this is a reliable source of information. The National Security Service says they traced it to Vadare therefore I trust them.,I understand from the new information that the hack came from the group described in the new information. However the new information doesn't give any new information saying that Vadare wasnt involved. Therefore I have not changed my mind
"The NCSC has localised the origin of the cyber attack to Vadare.  Given the extensive and ongoing nature of the attack, it is highly likely that the origin of the attack came from a source close to the nation of Idimire. The fact that the foci of the cyber interference is our democratic elections process and aerospace infrastructure, it seems evident that the culprit is another nation state.","The cyber attack has now been linked to a vigilante group.  It may still involve the nation state of Vadare, who are using the group as a conduit to interfere with our elections process.  Further analysis will be needed to confirm these suspicions."
"It's been tracked to that country, however,it could mean that someone else is making it look that way. ","I guess this has confirmed even more that it was a group trying to make it look like Vadare... however, they could be from / represent Vadare "
My team is well skilled and they have informed me of the source. However confidence is not complete because it has been stated to me that the attack my have been made to look as if it came from Vadare by another hostile country.,It now appears that the attack is from in independent group of hackers. They get their fun by stirring things up and imply that the source is a neighbouring country.
I believe they may not actually be involved in this.     There is  doubt due to people being able to change IP addresses and making it look as through they’re in a different place. Could be another party involved trying to create conflict between the two countries. Surely vadare’s air control would be affected if ours were to go wrong. ,For the same reasons as before. The changing of IP address.  The fact that’s it’s come from an actual group of hackers confirms my suspicions that’s it’s not vadare acting. 
"i would put it to the fact that the NCSC actually traced it back to actual governmant pc's in Valdare! and presume it is in there interests to attack our systems and in any investigation you follow who would benefit from the crime, in this case it is Valdare...",i have changed my opinion due to you releasing new information on the situation - had you put this in the prior statement i would have placed my marker right in the middle until a full investigation had been completed and all possibilities are eliminated - then i would reach a decision 
Innocent until proven guilty. We need to undertake a complete investigation. Modern governments mostly blame who they want to blame and sometimes this is open to question and other times this is plainly wrong. Deterioring relations between two countries could led to disaster etc.,"New information suggests that the attack was carried out by an independent group. I feel I was right to be sceptical in the previous situation, although I did have an open mind and Vadare might have been responsible."
I trust the NCSC to have provided me with reliable intelligence that traced the source of the attack back to computers hosted in vadare,"While the hacker group may be based in Harare, they do not operate as a government arm. They act independently "
It is possible that the attack came from Vadare but as it was a cyber attack their geographical closeness is not sufficient reason to be sure. ,New information has come to light that the attack was a malicious one but not for political gain or profit.
"the assessment of where the cyber attack came from should be easy to identify through the use of IP addresses.  This does not necessarily mean that the attack did come from Vadare as IP addresses can be spoofed through the use of a VPN, it also, does not confirm that Vadare are bahind the attach as even if the location is within Vadare there could be other players involved attempting to pretend it was led by vadare.",A hacking group may or may not be based in vadare but regardless if they are behind the attack vadare cannot be held responsible.
"The two computers came from Vadare. however, the signal may have been bounced across other countries so the perpetrator may have been located elsewhere. There is no more evidence to suggest that Vadare is definitely involved. ",There is no new information to confirm where this group is located although computers were found located in Vadare. 
"The national cyber security Centre has traced the attack back to the government of Vadare. This information is very specific, attack wasn't traced to just any computer systEM but to those of the government of Vadare. Due to the competence and trust put on the activities of NCSC, it is highly likely that the attack emanated from the government of Vadare.",The attack has been revealed to come from a group called  cyber chaos crew which does not rule out the fact that they could be directed by the government of Vadare. Most forensic analysis would be need to know the motive and those who collaborated with the known group
"Although the attack was traced back to government computers based in Vadare, this does not necessarily mean they were operated by people from Vadare. The computers could have been hacked by some other remote source based in a different country, exploiting security vulnerabilities.",A hackers group has been found to have been responsible for the breach. They have exploited government computers to do such attacks in the past. It is therefore likely that Vadare was not involved in the cyber-attack.
The intelligence indicated that the attack came from Vadare. However it could be individuals in the country or another country making it look like the attack is coming from Vadare.,The new information seems compelling. It aligns with activities the hacktivist group have been undertaking.
"Although the incident appears to be coming from Vadare, it could easily be spoofed to show it is coming from there but it is infact coming from another location. Further investigation needs to be carried out to determine the true source of the attack. Having the attack coming from government computers in another country is fairly obvious. Making accusations against said country could be very damaging to the relationship between the two if wrong. ",Will not change my earlier assessment as it has been proved that that the Valdare government where not directly responsible for the attacks.
It looks like this was the case bit the evidence is not conclusive so I could never be totally sure and would be assuming,With the new evidence it no longer looks like the case but once again can't be totally sure
"It appears that the attack originated from Vadare as my country traced it back to 2 computers based in that country.  However, I couldn't be sure as it was my country who did the investigating so there could be some biases.",I'm not any more convinced as the only extra information I've been given is the name of the hacktivist group.  It's possible that the group is more widely spread across other countries so there's a possibility that it didn't originate from Vadare.
I think the cyber attacks are more likely to of come from Vadare because there is a record showing that the leads lead back to Vadare.,I now think that the attacks could of come from outside of Vadare because a cyber group could hide their location.
"I feel that a cyber attack could come from anywhere around the globe. I would be wary to allocate the attack to somewhere without solid proof, as there could be repercussions. I feel that any country capable of launching a cyber attack, may also be able to make that attack appear to come from elsewhere. I would be wary of any agenda behind an attack.","I wasn't confident before without further evidence, but I now know that there are other groups out there which are causing these attacks.  I still feel that a state could be hiding behind, or funding any groups, so would still be unsure to release information about the supposed cause of the attack."
Assumed imformation previously given was correct but not 100% confident. Unsure if Vadare are aware of source and what steps they are taking to resolve. Unsure if  Vadare has been hacked or  made deliberate act as no information given re relationship between the two countries.,Assuming hacker information correct suspect Vadare's role is unwitting and hackers are using them as intermediary having accessed their computers. Despite new information I have no reason to doubt original information. Believe way forward is to alert Vadare and secure own country's systems.
Indications are that the attack came from the neighbouring country and as such our research would implicate them. as they have attacked other areas of our cyber activity it is reasonabl;e to assume that they are the source of this new attack.,The new information gives a situation where the attack may have been carried out for fun but does not preclude the attackers being instructed by our neighbours. Vigilance is still required as to the source of the attack.
"The cyber attack was traced back to the government in Vadare by officials so that would youneould think conclusively indicate that that’s where the attack came from, but cyber attackers are clever and could have intended it to look like that to throw suspicion off the actual source.  Depending how corrupt the government is could also indicate foul play, yes it’s easier to vote online, but it might be easier to ‘doctor’ paper ballot results to suit the government.  I’d question what the cyber attackers have to gain from the attack...or who else might be at gain...what does vadare have to gain?...might it actually be an internal job and they are just being used as scape goats?","Indicating that an attacker known to target the government systems does suggest that it could have come from there, that coupled with the forensic evidence, but I still have my doubts as to why there, and what they have to gain, or are they just being used as scape goats."
"Because it said that the attack had been traced back to government computers in Vadare, so that seems to be conclusive evidence to me","The information doesn't state which country the Hackers are based, so I am unable to tell if they come from Vadare, as they could've hacked into the computer system there and be based somewhere totally different"
The disruptive computer activity has been traced to computers in Vadare.,"Although a new 'hacking' group has been identified, this doesn't alter that the current activity was traced to computers in Vadare."
"I believe this as it was traced back to government computers in Vadare, however I am not 100% confident as I don't know how reliable the vignette was","Due to the new forensic evidence, it seems it was not gorvenment computers that hacked, but an active hactivist group. I changed my decision as I am less confident now that new information was shown to me"
The country next to us had economic reasons to try to disrupt our lives. The cyber attack caused us to revert to a less efficient system. The attack endangered lives by targeting air traffic control.,The evidence showed that this group might not be from our neighbors. Indeed the criminal hackers may just have attacked us because they could. There may not have been any political motivation.
"I don't think the cyber attack was an inside job,as it was probably done by those from outer countries with intentions to disrupt the election to gain lack of faith in the system from supporters. Vadare was innocent of participation.","I don't think the cyber attack was from vadare,as it was  done by those from those with intentions to disrupt the election to gain lack of faith in the system from supporters. Vadare was innocent of participation."
The National Cyber Security Center traced the attack to Vadare. There were government computers involved. I trust that the national Cyber Security Center has provided the correct information.,I have lowered my confidence score. The attack was linked to government computers in Vadare so there is a chance that the attack still occurred in Vadare. However there is a chance I feel that the hackers are sophisticated and the attack may have been set up to look as if it had originated from Vadare.
The NSCS is confident that the cyber-attack originated in Vadare as it was traced back to government computers located in Vadare.,New information now suggests that the cyber-attack may have been conducted by a cyber-terrorist group known as CyberChaosCrew who typically target governments.
"I am slightly more confident than not that Vadare was the origin of the cyber attack. This is due to traces of the attack leading back to Vadare. However, there remains a possibility that the traces could be false and a decoy to mislead away from the true origin of the cyber attack.",It was revealed that another party was responsible for the attack. Therefore it is now very unlikely that Vadare is to blame. Although with cyber attacks you can never be certain of their origin. 
Valdere seem to be the most likely suspects. There is not sufficient evidence to be absolutely certain. I suspect it is them but do not have enough to go on to accuse them directly. ,We still do not know whether Valdere did this but now there is evidence to suggest a specific group carried out the attack. We still do not know whether Valdere and the CyberChaos crew are working with Valdere.
"Assuming that NSCS is a reliable operations unit the attack would be correct. Vadare might be a malevolent country seeking to disrupt the ecomony/ government of it’s neighbor (us), for it’s personal gain, whatever that maybe.  ","Although Vadare may not be a friendly neighbour, reassessment is necessary. Although the hackers might be responsible, there still could be a double bluff scenario."
"I was told it came from Vadare, so I have no other option to believe it. I could carry out further investigations to ensure this is the location of the attack. But so far I have nothing else to go on.",Vadare could of hired the attack. Or the group could be based in Vadare. I have no other info to base this on.
"They have a motive, as the attack will destabilise the country.  All evidence so far points to them.",The hackers may use each country’s suspicions of the other to cause anarchy in both countries. A dare still has a motive however.
"The vignette stated that the government had traced the attack back to Vadare, but no supporting information was given on this. It is difficult to trust statements that come from governments/intelligence agencies particularly when no further info was given. It was only two days ago that it was reported as well, sometimes things change over time as new info comes to light.","Now that there is new information, it is quite possible that it was this hacktivist group and not Vadare therefore my confidence has gone down. However, the new information could also be false as maybe Vadare have framed the hacktivist group. It is difficult to know what to believe in situations like this, particularly when the evidence has not been disclosed."
It seems likely that the cyber-attack came from Vadare as it has been traced back to government computers in this neighbouring country. In addition there have been problems with air traffic control systems which further implicate Vadare.,I have decided to change my earlier assessment about who was responsible for this cyber-attack. This judgement is based on new forensic evidence which suggests that an activist group have hacked into government computers. I am therefore no longer confident that the cyber-attack had anything to do with Vadare although a final conclusion has yet to be reached.
"I would base my level of confidence in this case on the fact that our national security centre indicated that they were able to trace the attack to Valdare. Although certainly it's possible that they could have made a mistake (if perhaps the attach was done via proxy or something, I'm not sure if that's possible), nevertheless I would have to make the assumption that our security centre has the top experts in the field and that if they're certain that they've pinpointed that this is where the attack came from, then surely they must most likely be correct. However, not knowing further details or whether they themselves (the security centre staff) had any doubts, I assigned this an 8 rather than a 10.","The new information does not contradict what was previously stated.  So, based on this, I would think it's safe to assume that this hactivist group was operating within Vadare. Therefore, since the information does not contract, it is still reasonable to have 80% confidence that the attack came from Vadare at this point, unless further information later contradicts this."
"While it is suspected that Vadare is behind the cyber attack, no final proof was presented. It's important to go in depth to really discover who is behind the attack. While it is probable that Vadare is the one doing it, we need not to exclude others from the possible suspects.","There is a need to discover the nationality of the hackers. They might be from Vadare, but they might as well be from our country. The apprehension of the hackers crew is paramount, and help from Vadare itself might be given if they don't feel like they are under accuse."
"It has been traced back to have come from Vadare, possibly an attempt to undermine or control the political order in my country",If the attack is from a known cyber group with a well known history of similar attacks the source of the attack is not related to the country of origin but rather the individuals who run the organisation
I am the director of NCSC and as such I am confident that the attack must have been from Vadare ,"CyberChaosCrew could have been acting on behalf of Vadare's government. There's also no mention of where they are based, it is still possible that they reside in Vadare. However given that they usually attack for fun I am only 50/50 on whether the attack was Vadare's fault"
"It is possible that the cyber attack came from Vadare, especially if there has been growing conflict between the two countries. However, it is also possible that the attack could be complex enough that it implicates Vadare without Vadare actually being involved. If a section of the community within Idimore wished to cause disruption with the aim of increasing tension between the countries, This would be possible through such an attack. The same could apply to any other country or group wishing to cause disruption. It is even possible that such an attack occurred due to Computer  geeks  seeing how far they could go to break into systems with high levels of protection, without thought of potential outcomes.","My confidence level has decreased due to the new information as I had already considered such a possibility previously. This can and does happen (e.g. USA demands for the exportation of a British nation who broke into government systems to explore his ability to do that) and therefore it is possible that the attack was from an outside source, not connected to Vadare. Hackers seem to be able to keep up with new systems."
"Based on the information given, it was an unproven assumption that the cyber attack came from Vadare. We were told this was the case, but not how that conclusion had came about.  Could it have been another country or an internal problem?",I still don't see how there is prof that the attack came from Valdare. The further information identifies the group they believe t be responsible but we do not know where this group originates or is based
Since Vadare is a neighbor country they could be planning an attack to overtake our country. It could also be a political issue,"It was proved that it was an hacktivist group, but they could have been paid by Vadare  to do it"
"Cyber attacks are difficult to trace and hostile governments can base their attacks in other countries, making it harder to trace where the original hostile intent lay.  However, it is worth considdering what the general political situation is like between Vadare and our country, and whether this attack is consistent with a generally hostile foreign policy between our nations.","As stated previously, it is possible that Vadare was able to outsource its cyber offensive to this group and use them as a proxy to attack our country.  Again it is important to maintain dialogue with Vadare through official chanels and not let this be the only thing that informs our view of our international relations."
"The National Security team have indicated that the attack came from Vadare. As such we should trust their findings and take them seriously, even if they can not be 100% sure of the identity of the culprit(s).",Following further forensic analysis it appears that on this occasion Vadare were not behind the attack. This doesn't mean that the Security Centre cannot be trusted in future. Attacks come from many places.
"Although no background has been given as to the possible motives of Vadare, I must take at face value the professional advice of my team who have told me that the attacks have originated from there. ","The initial report was plausible but now further forensic testing has been conducted, I’m more inclined to believe the new suspected origin of the attack. "
"Vadare, our enemies of old. They would stop at nothing to interrupt our glorious country's march into the future, they've shown their true colours throughout our long histories. Of course it was them, curse them. We traced the attack back to Vadare government servers, there can be no doubt.","This is, of course, a diversionary tactic used by Vadare. Either they paid this group, or merely framed them."
"The intelligence received traced the cyber-hack back to a computer which was in Vadare. I am quite confident this is where the attack came from however, it is possible to bounce IP addresses to look as though they are coming from one place instead of it's actual location. I would base a lot of confidence in my country's IT intelligence team that this has been looked into but this is why I am not 100% confident.",It seems that the activist group os responsible for the attack but they could still be based in Vadare or simply claiming liability to further their cause. I would still not be 100% that Vadare was NOT involved until I had solid facts.
"The security systems have traced the attack back to Valdare, however, advanced hackers could have intended to set the attack up so that it would appear to have come from Valdare. I also don't know whether Valdare's officials were involved, or if it was a rogue attacker, and where they might be normally resident.","Again, this group are not representative of the entire country. The country where the computer was used may have been in Valdare, but the online group is probably international."
"As the attack was traced back to computer used by the government of that country, it would appear that their government officials are involved in the attack. It is an official policy rather than some random person. I'm assuming the agency who traced the attack is competent. I also assume that the country which originated the attack was not abole to cover their tracks by making it seem like it came from somewhere else, hence the 9 rather than 10 rating.",I'm a bit confused about where the attack may have come from but am still trusting the original report that stated it came from Vadare - maybe the hacktavist group hacked into the government computers of Vadare. I'm sure it wasn't a government attack though
"The source of information was a reliable source, who are experts in this field. I only put 8 as I would like to have discussions with them directly to be 100% confident ",Vadere is a neighbouring country so it still may have come from Vadare and it still may have been from a govt operated machine 
"I feel fairly confident that I can trust the NCSC to give accurate information and trace back the attack correctly. However, I do believe that someone with enough skill and the right technology could make the attack appear to be from somewhere it wasn't. ",It seems clear that the hacktivist group have more reason to perform the cyber attack and therefore I am more confident that it came from them. 
I think it is possible it is Vadare but not confirmed. I think it is possible as they are not necessarily friendly neighbours. We cannot prove it is them. Unless they agree it was caused by them I don't think I can be certain it was them.,I think that Vadare may have encouraged the hacker group. However the hacker group could have been working entirely independently. I still don't think that I could be certain it was Vadare behind them though which is why I kept my previous view but reduced my confidence a little.
"The attack has been traced back to computers of the vadare government highlighting that they could have played a role in the attack. However, the evidence is not strong and will need further investigation ","The information states that a group completed the attack. However, this does not mean to say that it had nothing to do with Vadare. It does look more likely now that they were not responsible"
The likelihood based on the information is that it has come from them but equally with computing it is more than possible to provide misinformation,nothing further has been provided other than this is a non-malicious/hostile group with little political motivation so I would suspect more that they are deliberately making it appear that the threat has come from Vadare
It traced it back to the computers at Vadare,It doesnt say where the Cyberchaos crew are based. They could be based anywhere
"The National Cyber Security Center have some of the best cyber annalists and are fully qualified to recognize and deal with this type of threat from a neighboring country. Currently the services affected by the cyber attack range from the National Elections being affected to air traffic control systems being disrupted. We have successfully traced the cyber attack back to government issued computers inside Vadare, which has lead to the conclusion that this is a politically motivated attacked designed at destabilizing this counties government at a vulnerable time. ","Further probing and research has shown us that the cyber attack was actually caused by a hacktivist group called CyberChaosCrew, this is still a politically motivated attack however, but now it was no longer done by Vadare and they are as much a victim as we are."
My subordinates have traced the cyber-attack to government computers operated by Vadare. The system appears to have been hacked just before an election to interfere with it. Also the attack is sophisticated and now spreading to air traffic control and causing serious problems with travel which could be dangerous.,"CyberChaosCrew may well have hacked into Vadare's computers to make it appear that the cyber-attack came from their computers. As there is a group specifically known for hacking government systems it's more likely to be them than any other organisation, especially when there is proof of it being from them. However it's not certain it's purely them as another government could employ them to interfere with a neighbour depending on the sort of government that neighbour has."
"The attacks have been traced back to Vadare, but hackers could easily hide the IP address of where they are. They could also try and point the finger of suspicion at Vadare by making the attacks seem to come from there. While Vadare remains the most likely suspect, I would need to investigate further to be sure.","The new information means it's likely that the hacker crew are responsible. They have a history of attacking for fun, but they could still have been funded in this attack by Vadare or another country."
"I am confident in my company and it's workers and their ability. They have traced the attack back to computers in Vadare. The attack is ongoing, giving my colleagues the time and evidence needed to make their findings more conclusive. However, before speaking to Vadare officials I wouldn't want to be 100% sure in my thoughts as, even with some evidence, they deserve a chance to explain and shouldn't be directly attacked at first point. ","I have changed my answer as new forensic evidence has suggested the attack came from an activist group who have been attacking government gateways for fun. This new evidence has brought in another highly likely culprit which needs investigation. I haven't put the result as low as 1, as there is always a chance that the group is acting upon orders from Vadare. This also needs to be investigated. "
The agency are usually quite accurate in their investigations. My understanding of the motivations of the Vadarian government also lead me to the conclusion that the attack probably originated there. However we must be certain that this is the case before taking action.,This new information is important but does not change everything. The fact that the attack did not come from a potentially hostile state however does not mean that there is not connection between the hackers and Vadare.
Vadare do or even may have some part in this attack but it is not certain. Reason for my answer is that it could of been another organisation that planted the attack for a number of reasons. Vadare is the easy target to blame here.,"As stated previously, Vadere may be working in coalition with the other organisation but it is not certain. Vadare, agree may have provided the information but alternatively they may have not and the new attackers planted this attack solely on their own."
"Although stated that the cyber attack has come from Vadare, there is no evidence to show it.  If there was a source of this information and also proof then I would be more confident in believing that the cyber attack came from there. Also if there was a context of previous tensions between the two countries then that would also make me more confident.","This group has a prior record of hacking government systems so it is likely that they are behind it. The fact that there has been further forensic analysis and another group found responsible makes me even less confident that Vadare is behind it.    However, it is possible that a wing of this hacking group is based in Vadare."
"The recent cyber attacks were traced back to Vadare.  The most likely reason is that they originated in Vadare, although I suppose it is possible that someone with advanced cyber skills would be able to lay a trail to Vadare.  Even if the cyber attacks originated within Vadare we would have no proof that the Vadarian government were implicated, or aware of the attack.",This CyberChaosCrew bunch of idiots could be based anywhere in the globe - they most likely don't even know each other.  I wouldn't blame Vadare and given this new information I don't think there is any proof that the attack came from Vadare.  I wouldn't be confident of pinning down any geographical location.
Fairly confident - the attack came from their government servers which I would assume are also very secure.,There is a possibility that the cyber group intended to cause a rift between the two countries 'for fun'
"The evidence appears to point towards Vadare being responsible. However, I am unsure what the evidence is and if it's reliable so I can't be completely confident at this time. I feel I need to exercise caution.",I am cautious just as I was before. This group may have caused the cyber attack but I am unsure why or if it was directed by anyone.
"I've no idea why Vadare would be involved in a cyber-attack and there certainly isn't concrete proof or their involvement. However, intelligence seems to indicate that Vadare is the source of the disruption.",My answer is the same as the previous one I gave. I could elaborate if I knew if Hacktivist came from or are based in Vadare. If they had an association with Vadare then the evidence would be more compelling.
